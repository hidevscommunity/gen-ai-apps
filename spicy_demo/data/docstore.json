(ADHD) is that they know what they need to do, but they have difficulties turning \ntheir intentions into actions. These difficulties also interfere with their ability to use self-\nhelp books and to get the most out of psychosocial treatments that provide coping strat-\negies that promise to improve their functioning. Drs. Ramsay and Rostain are experts \nin  the  assessment  and  treatment  of  adult ADHD  and  are  leaders  in  the  development \nof effective psychosocial treatments for this group of patients. Their newest book, The \nAdult ADHD Tool Kit: Using CBT to Facilitate Coping Inside and Out, is a coping guide \nfor adults living with ADHD, one that does not just present useful coping strategies but \nalso  provides  specific  tactics  designed  to  help  readers  implement  these  skills  in  their \ndaily lives and brings them to life in a user-friendly format. The authors discuss many \ndifferent settings in which ADHD may cause difficulties, including work, school, matters \nof physical health and well-being, and the issue of excessive use of technology. Although \nwritten for consumers, clinicians will find the book to be a clinically useful tool for their \nadult patients with ADHD, serving as a companion to the newly updated and expanded \nsecond edition of Drs. Ramsay and Rostain\u2019s professional treatment manual Cognitive-\nBehavioral Therapy for Adult ADHD: An Integrative Psychosocial and Medical Approach.\n\nJ. Russell Ramsay, PhD, is cofounder and codirector of the Adult ADHD Treatment and \nResearch Program and an associate professor of clinical psychology in psychiatry in the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine. He is cochair of the profes-\nsional advisory board for the Attention Deficit Disorder Association.\n\nAnthony L. Rostain, MD, is cofounder and codirector of the Adult ADHD Treatment \nand Research Program and a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics in the University of \nPennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine, where he is also director of education for \nthe  department  of  psychiatry.

Yes, \u201cA\u201d and \u201cH\u201d represent \nits symptoms, but they do not adequately describe the ADHD syndrome. ADHD is cur-\nrently understood as a disorder related to poor self-regulation or self-control\u2014adults \nwith ADHD have problems turning their intentions into the actions that are required to \nhandle many of the demands of daily life. More specifically, it is difficult for adults with \nADHD to proactively and consistently develop, organize, and enact and follow through \non  plans  over  time  for  which  there  is  a  future  (but  not  immediate)  pay  off.  Instead, \nADHD  adults  repeatedly  face  the  stress  of  looming  deadlines  or  crisis  situations  that \nresult from putting off tasks, only being provoked to action by an emergency situation \non par with trying to defuse a ticking time bomb.\n\nThink of all the stories and fables we learned as children about the virtues of planning \nahead and persevering on a task, such as the little pig that built a house of bricks, the \ntortoise who keeps a steady pace over a long race with the hare, religious teachings about \nthe benefits of self-restraint and self-control (\u201cThou shalt NOT . . .\u201d), etc. Each lesson \ninvolves deferring immediate gratification for a greater but distant reward. A famous \nstudy of self-control led by Walter Mischel had children sit alone in a room with a plate \nof sweet treats. The children were told that they could have a single treat of their choice, \nbut if they could wait without eating it until the examiner returned to the room, they \ncould  earn  a  second  one.  Some  children,  despite  the  promise  of  greater  reward,  suc-\ncumbed to the temptation to eat the single treat, losing out on the bonus; other children \nwere able to resist temptation long enough to earn the reward of a second treat. The \nmain finding of interest in what has come to be known as the \u201cmarshmallow study\u201d is \n\n\fxiv Preface\n\nthat the impulse control exhibited in childhood predicted later success at all points in \nlife, with the children who were able to defer gratification being better off on average, \neven 40 years later (Mischel et al., 2011).\n\nAlthough the lessons and solutions seem straightforward and have been reinforced by \ngrandparents, parents, teachers, bosses, fairy tales, cautionary tales, etc., self-regulation is \nmore multifaceted than it seems. There are many fundamental skills that provide humans \nwith the capacity to do what they want to do or need to do when they need to do it. These \nskills, known as the executive functions, operate in an exquisite choreography to help us \nnavigate the myriad demands of adult life. Hence, ADHD is currently understood as a \ndisorder of impaired executive functions. That is, the farther in the future the reward for \na behavior lay, the greater difficulty an adult with ADHD will have performing the neces-\nsary component steps in the here-and-now, thus decreasing the likelihood of achieving \nthe payoff (despite full awareness of the consequences). Alas, the penalties for poor self-\ncontrol in adulthood are much steeper than the loss of a marshmallow.\n\nADHD also involves distinct motivational deficits inasmuch as motivation is consid-\nered  the  ability  to  generate  emotions  that  help  you  to  engage  in  a  task  without  rely-\ning solely on an immediate reward or consequence. Adults with ADHD have difficulties \naccomplishing jobs that range from setting up a retirement fund (\u201cI\u2019ll get around to it \nlater.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "278c2d89-9523-47fb-9180-28505c1956e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "278c2d89-9523-47fb-9180-28505c1956e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fd539f4-8b6c-4c3d-b6cf-a824d895d61d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "476e0772fd261641ec2734f221cc51ee31e8ff79bf39b1b7537a064136ae8538"}, "3": {"node_id": "afec190c-e995-4c37-af2c-b98395d76cef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c926e87533aeb769c0c6de97fe4ab6bee779a8df24e3fcccc8ce41dc136dabf7"}}, "hash": "3e501414ded2d15a20732bc3646bc52052555e2449ac7746515d7688266364b5", "text": "I have time.\u201d) to something as immediate as mowing the lawn on a weekend after-\nnoon (\u201cI\u2019ll get around to it later. I have time.\u201d).\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, we established and have operated a specialized clinical \nprogram for the assessment and treatment of adult ADHD since 1999. An established \ntreatment  for  ADHD  is  pharmacotherapy,  the  use  of  medications  to  treat  the  core \nsymptoms  of  developmentally  inappropriate  levels  of  inattention,  impulsivity,  and/\nor  hyperactivity.  Similar  to  obtaining  corrective  prescription  eyeglasses,  effective \nmedication treatment of ADHD reduces the symptoms of ADHD, such as improving \nthe ability to sustain attention and to reduce restlessness and impulsivity. Although \nan  effective  and  safe  treatment  for  most  adults  with  ADHD,  medications  alone  do \nnot  necessarily  improve  behavioral  functioning  and  well-being  in  one\u2019s  day-to-day \nlife. That is, you may be less prone to distraction and fidgetiness while on a medica-\ntion, but you will not spontaneously complete your income taxes or get started on a \nmonthly report for work.\n\nThe other treatment we provide at our program is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), \na specific form of psychotherapy that has been adapted to address problems commonly \nencountered by adults with ADHD. The cognitive in CBT refers to the thoughts, beliefs, \nand attitudes that affect how we perceive and react to events, as well as our self-perception. \nNegative thinking has no causal influence on having ADHD, although it often develops as \na consequence of growing up and living with ADHD and trying to manage its effects on \nyour life. Said differently, you did not develop difficulties organizing and following through \non tasks because you have negative thoughts about them; however, the repeated difficulties \nyou have experienced because of ADHD have likely given rise to pessimistic outlooks about \nthese tasks, which, along with even residual symptoms of ADHD, create a double whammy \nand make it even harder to follow through on them, that is, insufficient motivation.\n\nThe behavioral in CBT refers to one\u2019s actions and to the therapeutic process of devel-\noping  a  more  adaptive  behavioral  repertoire  with  which  to  cope  with  ADHD.  Once \nmore, having ADHD does not result from the fact that self-control behaviors were not \n\n\fPreface xv\n\nadequately emphasized by your parents when you were a child or from eating too much \nsugar-coated cereal. Indeed, individuals with ADHD \u201cknow\u201d quite well how to handle \nthe situations that cause them problems. Ask a grade school student with severe ADHD \nwhat he should do if he knows the answer to a question asked by the teacher during class, \nand he will correctly answer, \u201cRaise my hand and wait to be called on by the teacher.\u201d The \ncrux of the problem is that ADHD interferes with the student\u2019s execution of the behav-\niors required to obey this rule during class.\n\nCBT for adult ADHD, as in other \u201ctalk\u201d psychotherapies, involves regularly scheduled \noffice meetings. By necessity, these meetings occur outside the environments in which \nindividuals with ADHD experience the difficulties that bring them to treatment. The \nnecessary solutions for the common problems related to managing ADHD are obvious \nand logical\u2014use of a planner, getting started earlier on tasks, spending time organizing \nfiles, etc.\u2014but the problem is carrying out these solutions in your daily life at the \u201cpoint \nof performance.\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, our goal for this tool kit is to share the ways we have tried to make the cop-\ning tools for adult ADHD \u201csticky\u201d so that they will stay with you and you will be able to use \nthem to positive effect in your day-to-day life.\n\nThe purpose of this handbook is to serve as a coping resource for adults with ADHD \nin order to increase the consistent use of effective coping strategies that will improve \none\u2019s ability to manage his or her daily affairs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afec190c-e995-4c37-af2c-b98395d76cef": {"__data__": {"id_": "afec190c-e995-4c37-af2c-b98395d76cef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "278c2d89-9523-47fb-9180-28505c1956e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e501414ded2d15a20732bc3646bc52052555e2449ac7746515d7688266364b5"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c62fc2f-30db-4ecc-a78c-8e6fc7db71d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "69dac42c26ab8bbaa4583895247466a6afe8b6a9338442395ecd3ab77688b86f"}}, "hash": "c926e87533aeb769c0c6de97fe4ab6bee779a8df24e3fcccc8ce41dc136dabf7", "text": "Of course, the notion of a \u201cself-help\u201d or \n\u201cdo-it-yourself \u201d book for adult ADHD, a condition that we have already identified as \na  problem  related  to  poor  self-regulation  (i.e.,  core  difficulties  with  self-help),  might \nseem oxymoronic\u2014or maybe just moronic. The executive function/motivational deficit \ndefinition of ADHD we described would make it seem that ADHD interferes with your \nability to make changes in a do-it-yourself fashion. We do not expect that simply read-\ning about what you need to do will make you more productive. If that were the case, any \none of the excellent books on adult ADHD already on the market would have sufficed.\nRather, we envision this book as akin to a tool kit, an assemblage of a variety of cop-\ning tools that can be accessed whenever needed. The strategies herein have been adapted \nto the needs of adults with ADHD, acknowledging and addressing the very problems \nthat make it difficult to use them. Hence, we emphasize implementation tactics that will \nincrease the likelihood of using these skills at the point of performance, and so that they \nwill be used enough that they will become habitual and less effortful, akin to tasks such \nas  brushing  your  teeth,  making  coffee  in  the  morning,  or  any  other  task  you  reliably \nperform, even on your worst day. Of course, if you find that you have drifted away from \nusing the skills, you can return to a relevant section of the tool kit for a refresher.\n\nPsychologists, counselors, or other nonphysician mental health professionals cannot \nwrite prescriptions for medications; however, we can write \u201cbehavioral prescriptions\u201d or \nwritten reminders of important behavioral strategies. One of the reasons CBT for adult \nADHD has been found to be an effective psychosocial treatment for adult ADHD is the \nfocus on the use of coping skills during the 167 hours of the week outside of the weekly \ntherapy hour. Spending time planning how to implement coping strategies during the \nweek and writing out summary coping reminders of the plan increases the likelihood of \nthe timely practice of coping principles outside of the office.\n\nThus, in addition to discussing foundational coping skills for adult ADHD, many sec-\ntions of the tool kit will include straightforward \u201ctake away\u201d points comprised of a list \n\n\fxvi Preface\n\nof step-by-step reminders for instituting them. These take away points offer reminders \nthat can be referred to or carried with you to help you to turn intentions into actions \nwhen it counts. Similar to having a recipe for cooking, even if you say \u201cI cannot cook,\u201d \nyou are able to follow each of the individual steps required to prepare a basic dish. The \nimplementation of these strategies sets the stage for the most powerful source of rein-\nforcement in developing coping skills for adult ADHD, which is your \u201cfelt experience\u201d \nwhen carrying out a plan, seeing positive results, and gaining confidence in your ability \nto handle situations that previously seemed overwhelming. Just as with cooking, you can \npersonalize the recipes to your unique circumstances, but at the very least, they provide \nan anchor point to help you get started (or restarted when dealing with coping drift).\n\nThis  clinical  tool  kit  reflects  the  principles,  skills,  and  methods  used  in  our  clinic, \nwhich are very similar to those used by other clinicians with an expertise in adult ADHD. \nWhile many of the coping strategies will be familiar to readers of other books on manag-\ning adult ADHD, we have tried to emphasize the factors that promote the implementa-\ntion of the coping skills combined with specific tactics to use in real time. These factors \nwork together to make your coping plans \u201csticky\u201d so that they go with and are more \nlikely to be carried out and that you can get \u201cunstuck\u201d in various situations in your life.\nOf course, no book will be able to address each and every situation you will face, but \nwe  have  attempted  to  cover  the  most  common  problem  areas  encountered  by  adults \nwith ADHD in a way that can be generalized to other situations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c62fc2f-30db-4ecc-a78c-8e6fc7db71d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c62fc2f-30db-4ecc-a78c-8e6fc7db71d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "afec190c-e995-4c37-af2c-b98395d76cef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c926e87533aeb769c0c6de97fe4ab6bee779a8df24e3fcccc8ce41dc136dabf7"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ee2338e-7188-4c7c-85b2-bdeac313b0c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1d82a8e2da91983d893f82302134d0fe02b8d385c4c6e9444f5e162a15bffa3"}}, "hash": "69dac42c26ab8bbaa4583895247466a6afe8b6a9338442395ecd3ab77688b86f", "text": "We have organized the \nbook in a logical sequence of coping skills from the basics of using prioritizing tasks and \nyour daily schedule to dealing with procrastination and negative thinking to handling \ndifferent  roles  in  your  life  as  well  as  maintaining  overall  well-being. Although  adults \nwith ADHD as a group encounter many common and familiar difficulties, each person\u2019s \ncoping needs will be different. Hence, readers are invited to jump to chapters relevant to \ntheir specific coping issues and need not read the book in order from beginning to end.\nWe encourage you to look for ways to get started using the coping skills outlined in \nthe coming chapters but to also be patient with yourself during the change process. We \nhope that by finding ways to implement these strategies in your daily life, you will notice \nimprovements. However, this sort of change process often involves taking two or three \nsteps forward and then one step backward. Change is hard work and it is important for \nyou to recognize and appreciate progress, even if it is not perfect. For example, maybe \na college student reports that he now hands in 80% of his assignments on time after \nhaving a semester when he was on time with only 50% of them. Although he strives for \n100% timeliness and views himself as still falling short of his goal, we use the reframe \nthat \u201cIf you and I invented a medication that helped someone improve this behavior by \nthe same 30% you have achieved, we\u2019d be billionaires right now.\u201d These sorts of posi-\ntive changes are valid, important to recognize, and will result in improved quality of life \nwithout having to use perfection as the benchmark.\n\nTo this end, our final wish is that you will use and overuse this tool kit. That is, as \nwith our attempts to provide evidence-supported treatments for adult ADHD that can \nbe personalized, this tool kit provides a useful framework of skills that you and others \nwith ADHD can use and make your own. Using the metaphor of a tool kit, we provide \nsome tools and some instructions for their use; you the reader can use these tools to \nbuild newfound opportunities and, more importantly, to be able to \u201cstick with\u201d your \nendeavors.\n\n\fPreface xvii\n\nA Note for Mental Health Clinicians\n\nAlthough written as a handbook for adults with ADHD who are seeking useful coping \nstrategies, this tool kit is also designed to be a resource for clinicians who treat adults \nwith ADHD. This tool kit is a companion to the second edition of our treatment manual, \nCognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adult ADHD: An Integrative Psychosocial and Medical \nApproach (Ramsay & Rostain, 2015), which provides information about the theoretical \nunderpinnings  of  the  CBT  model  for  adult ADHD,  the  case  conceptualization,  more \ndetailed discussion of many of the strategies in this tool kit, reviews of case examples \nand clinical challenges, and a review of the empirical support for this and similar CBT \napproaches for adult ADHD. We do not have a session-by-session prescription of topics \nto address, although this tool kit represents the way we divide up and implement coping \nskills with patients in sessions.\n\nThe development of this handbook stemmed from feedback provided by readers of \nthe first edition of the treatment manual. The most common request was for even more \nspecifics  about  coping  strategies  and  the \u201cnitty  gritty\u201d  of  how  to  implement  CBT  for \nadult  ADHD.  Hence,  we  have  tried  to  encapsulate  what  we  do  in  collaboration  with \nour patients, including the emphasis on the use and implementation of these skills in \ndaily life, which is the primary measure of their effectiveness. That is to say, we not only \ndiscuss the coping strategies but also discuss more specific \u201ctactics\u201d for how they can be \nput to use.\n\nThe  tool  kit  itself  provides  patients  with  an  externalized  reminder  for  therapeutic \nexercises  to  perform  as  well  as  a  means  for  personalizing  these  skills.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ee2338e-7188-4c7c-85b2-bdeac313b0c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ee2338e-7188-4c7c-85b2-bdeac313b0c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c62fc2f-30db-4ecc-a78c-8e6fc7db71d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "69dac42c26ab8bbaa4583895247466a6afe8b6a9338442395ecd3ab77688b86f"}, "3": {"node_id": "c81b7e0a-f586-43cc-a295-7dd9510341d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "675c1b40dac68ad965ba7f13fdda605bfebb29433343114c66c466b86f1d3a1d"}}, "hash": "a1d82a8e2da91983d893f82302134d0fe02b8d385c4c6e9444f5e162a15bffa3", "text": "The  take  away \nreminders can be copied to serve as coping cards and provide a means to make between \nsessions therapeutic exercises \u201csticky\u201d and portable in order to increase the likelihood \nthat  the  skills  will  be  implemented  at  the  point  of  performance.

Dana Bliss was the editor on the first \nbook we wrote and he enthusiastically supported our idea for The ADHD Tool Kit. After \nDana left Routledge, Anna Moore stepped in and was an equally encouraging and capa-\nble guide through the rest of the process.\n\nWe would like to thank all of the past and present members of our team at the Univer-\nsity of Pennsylvania\u2019s Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program. Operating a pro-\ngram such as ours requires a great deal of time management and organizational skills, \nand dedication by all involved to keep it running smoothly. We have been fortunate to \nwork with a variety of talented colleagues and trainees in order to provide evidence-\nsupported assessment and clinical services, as well as to provide training in adult ADHD \nto the next generation of clinicians.\n\nJRR would like to thank my wife, Amy, and my daughters, Abigail and Brynn, for all \nthe love and support they provide. My mother and sister also deserve thanks for their \nongoing encouragement.\n\nOne of the principles discussed in this handbook is establishing a work station that \nbecomes a target for and associated with productivity. To this end, JRR would like to give \na special word of thanks to the whole team at Main Street Java in Souderton, PA, which \nis where the vast majority of this book was written (and it will likely be the location for \nfuture projects of mine).\n\nALR would like to thank my wife, Michele, for her forbearance and encouragement, \nand my family and friends for \u201cbeing there\u201d for me through thick and thin. ALR also \nthanks my close colleagues at Penn along with the psychiatry residents whom I\u2019ve had \nthe distinct pleasure of supervising over the years\u2014for providing me with intellectual \nstimulation and honest feedback.\n\nFinally, we both wish to acknowledge the patients living with ADHD whom we have \nbeen  privileged  to  serve  since  our  program  started  in  1999. We  have  been  awed  and \nmoved by their various accounts of adversities in their lives, and inspired by the spirit \nand strength with which they take on the hard work of facing and transcending ADHD. \nAll of the advice we offer in this handbook has come from our clinical work, and thus we \nview this book as a tribute to adults with ADHD.\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u201cI know what I need to do, but I just don\u2019t do it. I\u2019ve tried to change on my own, I\u2019ve tried \nself-help books, and nothing has worked. How is this tool kit going to help me deal with my \nADHD when nothing else has worked?\u201d\n\nWhy Should I Expect That This Tool Kit Is Going to Help Me?\n\nThis  is  a  reasonable  question,  but,  as  with  many  issues  pertaining  to  Attention-Deficit/ \nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults, the answer to the simple question is multifaceted.\nFirst, most of the coping skills we will discuss in this tool kit are probably similar, if \nnot identical to those you will find in the many popular books offering advice for cop-\ning with adult ADHD. ADHD is not a problem of lack of knowledge about what to do, \nbut rather, it is a performance problem\u2014being unable to reliably do what you set out \nto do.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c81b7e0a-f586-43cc-a295-7dd9510341d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c81b7e0a-f586-43cc-a295-7dd9510341d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ee2338e-7188-4c7c-85b2-bdeac313b0c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1d82a8e2da91983d893f82302134d0fe02b8d385c4c6e9444f5e162a15bffa3"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b192d64-a388-4134-9fb8-97c2f2a3ff72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51289d3fd6bb76d036cac82e16f1411a32862908b66fa0ff8d63861c0c216ce9"}}, "hash": "675c1b40dac68ad965ba7f13fdda605bfebb29433343114c66c466b86f1d3a1d", "text": "Second,  because ADHD  is  a  skill  performance  problem,  the  similarity  of  the  cop-\ning strategies and approaches across different books and programs, and the repetition \nof this information, is not a bad thing; in fact, having multiple and diverse reminders of \nthese strategies helps to continually refresh the importance of these habits in your life. \nThe combination of the review of the skills with slightly different presentations of these \nideas across different formats provides a degree of novelty and offers you different takes \non old ideas. Just as in learning, the diverse presentation of ideas and lessons increases \nthe likelihood that these concepts will \u201cstick\u201d and come online during daily life when you \nneed them the most. Diet and exercise books consistently place among the top sellers \neach year, not because previous books did not provide useful advice, but rather because \nit is difficult to change these behaviors.\n\nThird, we have been posed a similar question by many patients seeking treatment \nthrough our Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program at the University of Penn-\nsylvania. The question usually takes the form of the one posed at the beginning of the \nchapter and ends with, \u201cSo, what is your treatment approach going to do for me that \nother treatments have not?\u201d\n\nOur answer has been, \u201cWe think we are good at helping adults with ADHD under-\nstand how they do not do things they set out to do.\u201d When you are able to recognize in a \nnuanced and personalized way the ways in which ADHD interferes with your endeavors, \nyou can then find many more pivot points at which to apply specific coping skills.\n\n\f2 Introduction\n\nFor example, many adults with ADHD aim to reduce procrastination. They set a goal \nto \u201cnot procrastinate\u201d and attempt to do all the things that they know they are supposed \nto do\u2014work on a project a little bit each day leading up to a deadline, have a plan of \nsteps to follow, etc. However, most of these ADHD adults will end up falling into old \npatterns despite the goal to \u201cnot procrastinate\u201d and despite the knowledge that they will \nregret putting things off. They may muddle through by using the pressure of a deadline \nto complete the task, but end up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed in the process.\n\nIt is not enough to know that you procrastinate, but you must understand how ADHD \naffects your procrastination as you go through your daily life. You need to be aware of \nthe component parts of your procrastination profile. This framework helps you to \u201csee\u201d \nhow you procrastinate and then to use some targeted skills to handle the specific barriers \nto your follow-through on tasks. Rather than the quick and familiar conclusion that you \n\u201cprocrastinated, again,\u201d instead, you will have a better grasp of the interplay of the effects of \nADHD on how you think about, feel about, and manage (or avoid) tasks. In turn, you can \nemploy specific tactics that help you apply your skills in order to change your procrastina-\ntion \u201cscript\u201d (rather than doing the same thing again and hoping for a different outcome).\nFourth and finally, in addition presenting the coping skills that are known to be effec-\ntive, we emphasize the implementation of these skills. Each of the chapters in this hand-\nbook includes discussions of the barriers to follow-through on coping strategies, ways to \npromote their use, and several step-by-step \u201ctake away\u201d reminders for carrying out these \nskills. You know what you need to do, but understanding the barriers and having a hard \ncopy of instructions akin to a recipe for doing what you need to do greatly increases the \nlikelihood of getting unstuck and getting engaged. Keeping copies of these reminders \nhandy in your daily life is a way to make the coping strategies portable so that you will \nuse them when they are most needed.\n\nOur approach asks a lot from you in terms of your commitment to change. The cop-\ning strategies and take away reminders are useful tools but are not immutable laws of \nphysics\u2014they must be used to be helpful. You will have to be willing to face and sus-\npend  your  doubts  about  your  ability  to  change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b192d64-a388-4134-9fb8-97c2f2a3ff72": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b192d64-a388-4134-9fb8-97c2f2a3ff72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c81b7e0a-f586-43cc-a295-7dd9510341d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "675c1b40dac68ad965ba7f13fdda605bfebb29433343114c66c466b86f1d3a1d"}, "3": {"node_id": "2055c75f-f5e6-4a45-9df2-19ba5a5299f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0934810f11a9cee85bfa9d4cfdd2a9ad5b3615275ec271c09f03f5943a514a5b"}}, "hash": "51289d3fd6bb76d036cac82e16f1411a32862908b66fa0ff8d63861c0c216ce9", "text": "These  doubts  may  be  based  on  past \nfrustrations or a view of yourself as being incapable of change. If your experiences are \nlike those of the untold numbers of patients with ADHD we have seen, you have likely \nalready invested a lot of time, effort, and money in trying to use these sorts of skills with \ndisappointing or at least incomplete results. One of the myths about adult ADHD that \nwe have encountered is the view that the diagnosis is \u201can excuse\u201d or \u201can easy way out\u201d \nof  facing  hard  work.

We hope that the approach described in this handbook will help you to get \nmuch better returns from the investment of your time and efforts.\n\nA starting point in this endeavor is to arrive at a shared understanding of what is \nADHD in order to understand, in fact, what it is that you are trying to manage better. We \nwill begin with a brief background on the diagnosis and history of ADHD. This review \nwill  conclude  with  a  contemporary,  scientifically  supported  model  for  understanding \nADHD and the difficulties with disorganization, poor time management, impulsivity, \nprocrastination, motivation, etc. that people experience in their daily lives. Finally, we \n\n\fwill extend this model of ADHD to the coping strategies discussed in this tool kit, our \nemphasis on implementation, and provide the rationale for this handbook and set up a \ncontext for its use.\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nAdult ADHD Background\n\nDespite claims that ADHD is solely an outgrowth of the frenetic pace of 21st century \nlifestyles  in  Western  society,  there  has  likely  been  ADHD  as  long  as  there  have  been \nhuman brains. The date of the first appearance of ADHD-related phenomena in clinical \nwritings has moved from 1902 and the publication of George Still\u2019s (1902/2006) lectures \non overactive and inattentive children to the late 18th century and the writings of the \nphysician Alexander Crichton (1798/2008), and most recently, settling on 1775 and the \nobservations of Melchior Adam Weikard (Barkley & Peters, 2012). The salient point is \nthat ADHD is not a recent syndrome and that it has caused problems for affected indi-\nviduals wherever and whenever it is found.\n\nNonetheless, the advent of compulsory education in the 20th century created a situ-\nation in which children entered classrooms, en masse. A classroom filled with children \nthat is presided over by a single teacher for several hours of instruction is a setting that \nrequires a reasonable degree of developmentally appropriate self-control. Moreover, this \ncontext shed light on behavioral and learning difficulties that may have been covered up \nin other situations (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014).\n\nThe  syndrome  now  known  as ADHD  was  given  a  variety  of  names  over  the  years \nbefore being first described in the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-\nual (DSM-II; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1968) as the \u201chyperkinetic reac-\ntion of childhood (or adolescence)\u201d with a 22-word description, including the assurance \nthat \u201cthe  behavior  usually  diminishes  in  adolescence.\u201d  The  diagnosis  was  renamed  as \nAttention  Deficit  Disorder  (either  with  or  without  Hyperactivity)  in  DSM-III  (APA, \n1980) and DSM-III-R (APA, 1987). Many people continue to refer to the disorder as \nAttention Deficit Disorder or ADD, even though it was renamed as Attention-Deficit/\nHyperactivity Disorder in DSM-IV (APA, 1994). ADHD is listed in the fifth edition of \n(DSM-5; APA, 2013) under the section on neurodevelopmental disorders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2055c75f-f5e6-4a45-9df2-19ba5a5299f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2055c75f-f5e6-4a45-9df2-19ba5a5299f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b192d64-a388-4134-9fb8-97c2f2a3ff72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51289d3fd6bb76d036cac82e16f1411a32862908b66fa0ff8d63861c0c216ce9"}, "3": {"node_id": "e41c8056-7294-4e50-976f-bf0c7153c6a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "be975d0772a77cec5c0bf4b0bfb62f7a1025e4b7b60ca9f1fb90d997a60cfcf9"}}, "hash": "0934810f11a9cee85bfa9d4cfdd2a9ad5b3615275ec271c09f03f5943a514a5b", "text": "ADHD can \nbe further specified by different presentations: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, \nPredominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation, and Combined Presentation.\n\nStimulant  medications  were  found  by  accident  to  be  a  helpful  treatment  that  led \nto improved attention and self-control in children.

Cross-\nsectional and longitudinal research has indicated that ADHD persists in well over 50% of \nchildren diagnosed with ADHD, probably closer to two-thirds of them. Lower persistence \nrates are often obtained when strict diagnostic criteria are used that may not adequately \ncapture the manifestations of symptoms in adults with ADHD. It is estimated that 4.4% \nof the adult population in the United States exhibits ADHD, with similar prevalence rates \n(3.4%) obtained in international samples (Fayyad et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2006).\n\n\f4 Introduction\n\nThe past 20+ years have witnessed a rise in genetic and neuroimaging research aimed \nat understanding the etiology of ADHD. For instance, ADHD is known to have complex \ngenetic underpinnings for which there are different pathways and forms, unlike a simple \ngenetic trait, such as eye color. The advent of neuroimaging technology has shed light on \nthe architecture and workings of different brain regions implicated in the manifestations \nof ADHD. Multiple brain systems have been implicated in ADHD that individually and \nin concert add to our conceptualization of the symptoms of ADHD, as well as the variety \nof developmental trajectories and clinical presentations of the syndrome.\n\nA meeting point for this and other research on ADHD has been the executive func-\ntions. Although difficult to define precisely, the executive functions have been described \nas higher-order cognitive skills that manage and choreograph a variety of brain func-\ntions in order to efficiently and adequately address the demands of our environment. \nMetaphors of \u201cconductor\u201d or \u201cmanager\u201d often are invoked to illustrate the role of the \nexecutive functions on behavior.\n\nADHD is currently considered a developmental disorder of impaired executive func-\ntions.  Using  a  definition  established  by  Dr.  Russell  Barkley,  the  executive  functions \nrepresent\n\nthe use of self-directed actions so as to choose goals and to select, enact, and \nsustain actions across time toward those goals usually in the context of others \noften  relying  on  social  and  cultural  means  for  the  maximization  of  one\u2019s \nlonger-term welfare as the person defines that to be.\n\n(Barkley, 2012, p. 176)\n\nSaid differently, individuals with ADHD have problems organizing and following through \non tasks and endeavors that will create a desired long-term outcome, but for which there \nis not sufficient short-term reward. After providing this definition to a newly diagnosed \nman with ADHD, he slapped his knee and exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s it! My boss always said that \nif he needed something from me in 10 minutes, he got it in 5 minutes; if he needed it from \nme in 10 days, it took me a month.\u201d\n\nExecutive  functions  have  generally  been  viewed  as  a  single  factor,  but  according  to \nKessler et al. (2010), some semi-distinct factors relevant to day-to-day life are the following:\n\nTime management\nOrganization/problem solving\nSelf-motivation\nImpulse control (inhibition)\nEmotional management\n\nAlthough counted among the executive functions, motivation holds a distinct place in \nthe contemporary view of ADHD. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that pro-\nvides you with the sense of reward and pleasure in different situations. Individuals with \nADHD have less dopamine available in the brain\u2019s reward networks (Volkow et al., 2011).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e41c8056-7294-4e50-976f-bf0c7153c6a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e41c8056-7294-4e50-976f-bf0c7153c6a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "2055c75f-f5e6-4a45-9df2-19ba5a5299f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0934810f11a9cee85bfa9d4cfdd2a9ad5b3615275ec271c09f03f5943a514a5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "469c8f65-e6c1-45dd-a9ec-49d22cd6760c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a22b354b4945b2071554b38c64e12ff4afd710d243f8ae916c587979d7145555"}}, "hash": "be975d0772a77cec5c0bf4b0bfb62f7a1025e4b7b60ca9f1fb90d997a60cfcf9", "text": "Thus, it is more difficult for someone with ADHD to generate the drive to engage in a \ntask unless it is inherently enjoyable, or if there is some other strong incentive for doing \nso, such as the pressure of a deadline. There is also an aversion to the delay of rewards \n\n\fIntroduction 5\n\n(i.e., delay of gratification). This delay makes it more difficult to generate the motiva-\ntion to persist toward longer-range goals even though you logically know that they are \nimportant. Many tasks in daily adult life are important, but not necessarily exciting, such \nas running a household, keeping up with work, or managing finances. Even priority tasks \nthat are personally fulfilling may involve short-term inconvenience, such as exercise or \nstaying in touch with friends you don\u2019t see often.\n\nThis executive function/motivation model provides a useful framework for under-\nstanding and assessing ADHD as well as designing targets for treatment. More investiga-\ntion is needed to understand the dynamic interactions of brain processes that underlie \nADHD, but we now have a good understanding of what needs to be done to promote \nbehavior change.\n\nDevelopment of the Adult ADHD Tool Kit\n\nWhen we started the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Adult ADHD Treatment and Research \nProgram in 1999 (March 8, to be exact), there was not much in the way of research-\nbased treatments for adult ADHD. Medications offered a solid starting point seeing as \nthere were many FDA approved medications, primarily within the stimulant class, that \nwere effective for children and adolescents and for which there was research on their \neffectiveness for adults. However, it was not until 2003 that there was FDA approval of a \nmedication specifically for ADHD in adults.\n\nIt was apparent that medications alone, while beneficial and essential for most adults \nwith ADHD, did not provide sufficient treatment. That is, many patients continued to \nstruggle  with  various  quality-of-life  or  functional  issues  in  their  lives.  Life  problems \nand  impairments  related  to  executive  function/motivation  deficits  persisted  despite \nsymptom improvements provided by medications (and in some cases patients stopped \nmedications due to side effects). Hence, there was a need for adjunctive psychosocial \ntreatments that represent psychotherapy approaches modified to address the common \nissues faced by adults with ADHD.\n\nCognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  has  emerged  as  the  psychosocial  treatment  of \nchoice for adult ADHD based on research supporting its effectiveness, most often in com-\nbination with medications. CBT is a well-researched form of psychotherapy that was origi-\nnally developed by University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist Dr. Aaron T. Beck (1976), and \nit has been applied to a variety of emotional and behavioral problems. In an all-too-brief \nnutshell, CBT emphasizes the interplay of thoughts and behaviors and their influence on \nemotional reactions. Interventions emphasize coping strategies designed to help individu-\nals recognize and change distorted thoughts and to develop adaptive behavior patterns.\n\nNegative thoughts have nothing to do with why someone has ADHD, but they often \narise in the wake of the various life frustrations commonly experienced by adults with \nADHD. Thus, adults with ADHD may have pessimistic and otherwise negative attitudes \nabout projects at work, homework, managing finances, and virtually any responsibility \nof adult life that is associated with emotional frustration that, in turn, is the result of the \nvarious executive function/motivation problems characteristic of ADHD.\n\nThe effects of ADHD magnify and are magnified by the mounting stress associated \nwith tasks that non-ADHD adults seem to complete easily. Consequently, there develops \na braided cord of living with ADHD, coping frustrations, negative thoughts, emotional \n\n\f6 Introduction\n\ndistress or discomfort, and avoidant behavior patterns that lead most, if not all, of our \npatients to express the desperation that we introduced at the start of the chapter\u2014\u201cI \nknow exactly what I need to do, but I just cannot do it.\u201d\n\nBased on the observation of these patterns in our patients, we developed a model of \nCBT designed to address the needs of adults with ADHD. We have published open out-\ncome studies and case studies based on our approach, as well as our treatment manual \n(Ramsay & Rostain, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "469c8f65-e6c1-45dd-a9ec-49d22cd6760c": {"__data__": {"id_": "469c8f65-e6c1-45dd-a9ec-49d22cd6760c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "e41c8056-7294-4e50-976f-bf0c7153c6a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "be975d0772a77cec5c0bf4b0bfb62f7a1025e4b7b60ca9f1fb90d997a60cfcf9"}, "3": {"node_id": "df2e3fe4-5b27-4078-ae85-5c7dc020b8ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d75ab136a224cbfe935ca5a46b5c50828656b59cc78fcde77dab830cac07bf0"}}, "hash": "a22b354b4945b2071554b38c64e12ff4afd710d243f8ae916c587979d7145555", "text": "When asked to write a revised and updated second edition \nof the manual (Ramsay & Rostain, 2015), we recalled that the most common piece of \nfeedback we received from readers of the first edition (both professional and lay readers) \nwas the desire for even more specific \u201chow-to-do-it\u201d guidance for coping with ADHD. \nHence, this tool kit is meant to be a patient handbook that is a companion to the second \nedition of the treatment manual.\n\nWe  present  the  coping  strategies  in  a  logical  sequence  starting  with  planning  and \nprioritizing  tasks  and  moving  on  to  other  essential  coping  skills.

Thus, in addition to the vari-\nous internal coping strategies related to managing executive dysfunction, attitudes and \nself-esteem, behavioral strategies, and dealing with emotions and motivation, we discuss \nputting these strategies into action at school, at work, in relationships, and various other \ncontexts; hence the subtitle of the tool kit is, Coping Inside and Out.\n\nThe coping strategies themselves are probably not earth-shattering to you. They are \nsimilar to those that have been developed and studied independently and concurrently \nby our professional colleagues at other adult ADHD programs around the world. We \nhave the utmost regard and respect for these clinical programs and they (and their pub-\nlications) are listed in the Appendices.

Even though you know how to perform the \nstrategies listed herein, it is important to have reminders. Consequently, each chapter \nincludes a discussion of the common barriers to follow-through and targeted sugges-\ntions  for  ways  to  increase  your  implementation  of  these  skills.  The  most  convincing \nreinforcement  of  these  skills  and  what  will  increase  the  likelihood  of  their  becoming \nhabits is your actual gut-level experience that \u201cThis works. I can do this, even when I do \nnot feel like doing it.\u201d To this end, we use various take away reminders, metaphors, movie \nlines, and other ways to try to make the coping strategies \u201csticky,\u201d so that they stay with \nyou and so that you will be more likely to use them when you need them.\n\nIn the spirit of using one of these reminders, our goal is for you to have the experience \nthat Woody Allen\u2019s character described in the movie Husbands and Wives when facing \na potentially compromising situation: \u201cRight now I\u2019m feeling $30,000 of psychoanaly-\nsis dialing 9-1-1.\u201d We want you to \u201cremember to remember\u201d to use these skills when it \ncounts in your life.\n\nBefore you delve into the chapters, we want to set realistic expectations for the change \nprocess. That is, change is difficult. Even when you are logically aware that a behavior is not \nworking, there is likely some benefit you gain from it, even if it is short-lasting and trivial. \nFor example, delaying homework provides a temporary sense of relief (i.e., escape) from \n\n\fIntroduction 7\n\nfacing a potentially frustrating task.

That is, \nexecutive functions represent the self-regulation that allows you to identify and follow \nthrough on tasks across time in order to achieve personally relevant objectives. The issue \nfor most people with ADHD is not an absence of goals or lack of desire, but rather the \nfact that ADHD interferes with the consistent follow-through on the step-by-step pro-\ncess over time to achieve those goals, especially when the payoff does not follow soon \nenough. For example, we all want to be in better physical shape, but it is difficult to fol-\nlow through on the daily routine of eating better and exercising until we start to see the \nresults we want.\n\nThe issue for adults with ADHD is that it is even harder for them to break down long-\nterm or big goals into step-by-step plans and then consistently follow these plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c921273b-f904-483b-b231-c1e6877a1f7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c921273b-f904-483b-b231-c1e6877a1f7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "df2e3fe4-5b27-4078-ae85-5c7dc020b8ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d75ab136a224cbfe935ca5a46b5c50828656b59cc78fcde77dab830cac07bf0"}, "3": {"node_id": "99d12708-6afc-4f79-b7d6-893bacde14aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "24db2c47efe713ba766cb26481e59474922c616b8d8a9c5282c212219514013a"}}, "hash": "c431cf47095a1406407d85b5bf606e11e79d606b8ea2000390999e3a072714c4", "text": "To \nthis end, it is essential to have plans throughout your day that are concrete and specific. \nThese intentions help to create the structure and flow of your day.

One of the mistaken thoughts held by most adults with ADHD is that \u201cother \npeople do not have to go through all these steps in order to manage their day.\u201d This view \nmay trigger a long held sense of being different from others or serve as a rationalization \nfor not spending the time and effort to work on a To-Do List\u2014it is viewed as \u201cunnatu-\nral\u201d or \u201cweird,\u201d and therefore you convince yourself to not do it. You then reassure your-\nself that \u201cI\u2019ll just figure it out as I go\u2014I have a lot to do and I\u2019ll just start doing things \nand it will all get done.\u201d Unfortunately, skipping the planning step usually leads to the \nsense at the end of the day that \u201cI was busy and running around all day but I did not \naccomplish anything important.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most non-ADHD adults spend time planning their days and use some form of \na To-Do List. Someone without ADHD might be able to get away without writing down \nor  referring  back  to  their  tasks  lists,  and  their  follow-through  appears  to  be  effortless. \nThese  individuals  probably  have  developed  set  routines  such  that  it  now  requires  less \neffort to maintain them. Truth be told, everybody expends at least some time and effort \nto orchestrate their day.\n\nIn  terms  of  what  to  do,  we  recommend  spending  an \u201chonest\u201d  10  minutes\u2014a  full \nspan of 600 seconds\u2014devoted to working on the sorts of planning tasks we will outline \nbelow.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99d12708-6afc-4f79-b7d6-893bacde14aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "99d12708-6afc-4f79-b7d6-893bacde14aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c921273b-f904-483b-b231-c1e6877a1f7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c431cf47095a1406407d85b5bf606e11e79d606b8ea2000390999e3a072714c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "1db59a5e-aeca-4937-ba5f-f4d9e6079889", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfc6d9616bb4c4a3da1e06adbe3d577556af82c1574893de0fd7d1161e810b5d"}}, "hash": "24db2c47efe713ba766cb26481e59474922c616b8d8a9c5282c212219514013a", "text": "The only materials needed for working on the To-Do Lists are an electronic word \nprocessing file or spreadsheet, notepad feature of a smart phone, or simply (and prob-\nably the best way) paper and pen. The simpler, the better is a useful credo.\n\nThe more definitive and specific the plan for planning, the better; that is, we advise \nthat you choose a specific place where you will sit to work on your To-Do List and at \na  realistic  time  of  day  when  you  will  have  at  least  10  minutes  to  devote  to  it.

This time frame provides you with sufficient time to get engaged in and \ncomplete the exercise, and to \u201cremember to remember\u201d what you need to do.\n\nThe steps thus far have focused on getting you into the position to construct your \nplan. It is most helpful if these steps can be made routine, going to the same place at \nthe same time each day to spend your 10 minutes planning. Even when this routine is \ninterrupted, such as being out of town on business, the principles can be adapted to \nthe setting.\n\nIn order to prioritize and develop a list of tasks to perform on a particular day, it \nis necessary to have an understanding of the wide-ranging tasks, responsibilities, and \nobligations that provide you with a roll call of possible options. Hence, the next section \ndiscusses the role of the Comprehensive To-Do List.\n\n\fTake Away 2.1. Planning Time to Plan\n1.  Devote 10 minutes (600 seconds) to planning.\n2.

The To-Do List\n\nComprehensive To-Do List\n\nThe Comprehensive To-Do List is exactly what its name suggests: an all-encompassing \nlist of your various tasks, responsibilities, and undertakings. It can also be viewed as a \n\u201cdump list\u201d of all that you have to do. A commonly reported source of distraction and \nstress for many adults with ADHD is the attempt to keep in mind various obligations \nthroughout the day, with many additional items \u201cpopping into mind\u201d at inopportune \ntimes, including the awful, too-late recall of things forgotten (e.g., \u201cOh no, my sister\u2019s \nbirthday was yesterday and I forgot it!\u201d), as well as those looming issues that randomly \nmaterialize but are not yet urgent (e.g., \u201cValentine\u2019s Day falls on a Saturday this year. \nI\u2019d better not wait until the last minute to make dinner reservations.\u201d).\n\nThe Comprehensive To-Do List is an externalized and personalized record of every-\nthing you have to do rather than having to hold it in memory. The two-fold purpose \nfor  the  list  is,  first,  to  have  a  process  for  thinking  through  and  unloading  these  tasks \nand, second, to have an enduring record of them so that you do not have to continually \nremember and maintain the list in your head.\n\nYou will define how \u201ccomprehensive\u201d you want your Comprehensive To-Do List \nto be relative to your circumstances. For the most part, your Comprehensive To-Do \nList will extend out the next 1 to 6 weeks, with tasks relevant for the next week being \nmost important for your Daily To-Do List.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1db59a5e-aeca-4937-ba5f-f4d9e6079889": {"__data__": {"id_": "1db59a5e-aeca-4937-ba5f-f4d9e6079889", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "99d12708-6afc-4f79-b7d6-893bacde14aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "24db2c47efe713ba766cb26481e59474922c616b8d8a9c5282c212219514013a"}, "3": {"node_id": "caffb455-9fca-4236-a19c-dd4537b6644a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47fd29fe26a0d23a8f0c555aaaf52441e1caef2a8d097b86adaecc39dd608f7a"}}, "hash": "bfc6d9616bb4c4a3da1e06adbe3d577556af82c1574893de0fd7d1161e810b5d", "text": "However, there may be upcoming events \nthat  require  action  in  the  next  week  or  so,  such  as  vacation  plans,  business  trips, \npassport renewal, or work or school projects that should not wait until the last min-\nute. It is also useful to think through some endeavors that do not have a timeline, \nbut can be defined as tasks to be performed, such as investigating preowned cars to \nreplace yours that is starting to need more and more repairs, making a will, arrang-\ning for home repairs, or other tasks that are currently low urgency but will eventu-\nally become important.\n\nA  common  reaction  to  the  proposition  of  the  Comprehensive  To-Do  List  is, \u201cIt  is \ntoo overwhelming for me to think about and face everything I have to do every day.\u201d \nWe agree that it is overwhelming, which is the precise reason to get it out of your head, \ndown on paper (or in an electronic file), and then put in safekeeping for future reference. \nYou may have the experience of an important task popping into your head during the \nday and then it becomes a distraction from what you are trying to do in the moment, \nwhether it is the fact you are out of milk or need to schedule a car inspection by the end \nof the month. The Comprehensive To-Do List provides a place to jot down and store \nthese haphazard tasks and ideas.\n\nThe periodic review of the Comprehensive To-Do List helps you to remember and \ndefine  priorities,  and  to  incorporate  new  tasks  and  obligations  that  may  have  arisen \nsince the previous review. You are not meant to construct a new Comprehensive To-Do \nList each day; rather it is an exercise to zero in on what are your important short-, mid-, \nand long-range tasks over the next 6 weeks or so. Then again, many people find it useful \nto sit down from time to time to review and update their lists or to spend time going \nthrough  the  exercise  of  periodically  reconstructing  a  new  Comprehensive  To-Do  List \nfrom scratch as a way to get a handle on what needs to be done in the coming several \nweeks (and, honestly, sometimes the lists are misplaced and need to be reconstructed, \nbut this need not be an excuse to abandon the exercise).\n\n\fTake Away 2.2. Comprehensive To-Do List\n1.  Get a notebook or open a computer file that will be devoted to your \n\nComprehensive To-Do List.\n\n2.  Find a place free from distractions.\n3.  Write  down  all  of  your  obligations,  plans,  errands,  commitments, \nrecreational ideas, etc. for the upcoming 1 to 6 weeks (or whatever \ntime frame suits your needs)\u2014this is your \u201cdump list.\u201d\n\n4.  Store  your  notebook  or  computer  file  in  a  place  where  you  can \n\nretrieve it and refer to it later.\n\n5.  The  Comprehensive  To-Do  List  provides  you  with  reminders  of \ntasks  and  obligations  without  relying  on  your  memory.  Refer  to  it \nperiodically for helpful reminders of things that you can do, but this \nis not your Daily To-Do List.\n\n\u00a9 2015, The Adult ADHD Tool Kit, J. Russell Ramsay and Anthony L. Rostain, Routledge\n\n\f14 What Do You Have to Do? The To-Do List\n\nAnother way to think about the Comprehensive To-Do List is that it is akin to an \niTunes account that holds all your music and video downloads, and various apps. It is a \nlibrary of all your media. From this account, you can download onto your iPod the items \nthat are of most immediate importance to you. The Daily To-Do List represents your \ndownload of specific tasks for completion today, which is discussed in the next section.\n\nDaily To-Do List\n\nThe Daily To-Do List, as its name implies, is a daily list that represents a personalized \ncollection of task reminders that are relevant for you but that run the risk of being \nforgotten or put off.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caffb455-9fca-4236-a19c-dd4537b6644a": {"__data__": {"id_": "caffb455-9fca-4236-a19c-dd4537b6644a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "1db59a5e-aeca-4937-ba5f-f4d9e6079889", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfc6d9616bb4c4a3da1e06adbe3d577556af82c1574893de0fd7d1161e810b5d"}, "3": {"node_id": "feca4c56-f2c4-4f6c-a5cb-0fc9b5b4c49f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "343b47eedfd39626e009c23c2627a3d693d2cdd8f253855453e7da53d218728f"}}, "hash": "47fd29fe26a0d23a8f0c555aaaf52441e1caef2a8d097b86adaecc39dd608f7a", "text": "You probably do not need a reminder to go to work, but you will \nneed to devote an entry on you Daily To-Do List to make a specific business-related \nphone call or to devote time to a report during your work day. To-Do tasks represent \nthe jobs that require a targeted effort by you to perform in the course of your typical \nday, such as getting items from the grocery store, scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment, \nexercising, or a specific household chore (e.g., unload dishwasher). The Daily To-Do \nList can also be used to identify specific duties to carry out in other roles, e.g., class-\nroom parent, little league coach, etc.\n\nWhereas the Comprehensive To-Do List is meant to be a record of all your pending \nresponsibilities, the Daily To-Do List is meant to be an easy-to-access, disposable list of \ntasks for today. That\u2019s why we suggest that the Daily To-Do List be written on a small \nindex card or other piece of paper (e.g., back of an envelope) that can be kept in your \npocket or otherwise within easy reach (e.g., posted on a computer monitor or other \nvisible location). The index card\u2019s small size hopefully keeps the task list within reason, \nwith our recommendation being to start with only two or three tasks (and definitely \nno  more  than  five)  in  order  to  avoid  feeling  overwhelmed.  Smartphones  and  other \nelectronic devices offer easy-to-use and convenient notepad features that can be used \nfor this purpose. An old-school paper version still represents a quicker and easier way \nto access and refresh the information in your mind. The very act of writing out the list \nby hand improves the encoding of the tasks and to prime you for behavioral follow-\nthrough. In any case, it is important that you decide on a format that will be easiest for \nyou to use and maintain.\n\nAnother principle for constructing the Daily To-Do List is to define tasks in specific, \nbehavioral terms in order to increase the likelihood of follow-through. For example, you \nmay have an item on your list that says \u201cclean up kitchen.\u201d Although this is a personally \nrelevant  task,  worded  as  such  it  ends  up  being  too  overwhelming  because  it  involves \nnumerous smaller jobs (e.g., unload dishwasher, reload dishwasher, wipe down coun-\ntertops, clean inside of microwave, organize cupboards, etc.). You run the risk of getting \nstuck on deciding where to start, feel mounting stress, and end up avoiding the task, usu-\nally with a comforting but ultimately self-defeating rationalization, such as \u201cI\u2019ll check \nmy e-mail and then I\u2019ll be \u2018in the mood\u2019 to tackle the kitchen.\u201d\n\nAn essential coping skill that will come up again in later chapters is that of \u201cbreak-\ning large tasks into their component parts.\u201d This skill is not a shocking revelation for \nanyone with ADHD, but the Daily To-Do List provides an opportunity to implement \nthis  skill  in  specific  ways. As  was  illustrated  above, \u201cclean  up  kitchen\u201d  can  be  more \nspecifically and behaviorally defined as \u201cunload dishwasher and put away clean dishes \n\n\fWhat Do You Have to Do? The To-Do List 15\n\nwhere they belong,\u201d or whatever initial task seems manageable to you in that moment \n(e.g., \u201cI will unload the bowls.\u201d). If you complete that task and decide to do no more, that \nis fine. You may enter another kitchen-related task on your Daily To-Do List for the next \nday. On the other hand, most adults with ADHD (and everyone else, for that matter) \nhave had the experience that \u201cOnce I get started, I usually keep going.\u201d Consequently, the \ninitial specific and behaviorally defined task is designed to get you activated and engaged \nby making the first step manageable, akin to wading into the shallow end of the swim-\nming pool.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "feca4c56-f2c4-4f6c-a5cb-0fc9b5b4c49f": {"__data__": {"id_": "feca4c56-f2c4-4f6c-a5cb-0fc9b5b4c49f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "caffb455-9fca-4236-a19c-dd4537b6644a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47fd29fe26a0d23a8f0c555aaaf52441e1caef2a8d097b86adaecc39dd608f7a"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc4eff37-e09a-41f2-96cc-b95f745493b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b25568274ff33684692e211a3a0e0b525e67e0a1a34bdb0906dc73a4a7b43c2"}}, "hash": "343b47eedfd39626e009c23c2627a3d693d2cdd8f253855453e7da53d218728f", "text": "This initial step helps you begin, and you will likely end up doing more than \nyou anticipated because the task ends up not being as bad as you anticipated it would \nbe. The principle sounds simple, but it is the implementation of it that makes it effective.\nSimilar to reserving time to plan, another step you can take to increase follow-through \nis to define specific times when you will perform tasks on your Daily To-Do List. In effect, \nyou make an appointment with yourself for tasks\u2014including a start time and an end \ntime. You are probably trying to complete tasks on your To-Do List in the midst of man-\naging other commitments and responsibilities during your day, such as meetings at work, \nattending classes, or driving children to and from various activities. Consequently, you \nwill have to \u201cfind time\u201d during the flow of your day to, say, wash a load of laundry or call \nto schedule an appointment. However, what seemed at the start of the day to be a task easy \nenough to fit in \u201csomewhere\u201d ends up going undone in the midst of a hectic day.\n\nDevoting discrete increments of time to tasks is another way to keep them manage-\nable (e.g., \u201cI will put a load of laundry in the washer at 7 p.m. I will put it in the dryer \nat 7:30 p.m. That will leave me plenty of time to relax.\u201d). Again, making the task spe-\ncific and behavioral helps, such as the reminder \u201cI only have to carry one laundry bas-\nket down to the basement, put the clothes in the machine and turn it on. It will take me \nless than 2 minutes to get it started,\u201d which sounds less onerous than \u201cdoing laundry.\u201d\nBecause there is only so much discretionary time in the course of your day, it is impor-\ntant to prioritize the items you put on your Daily To-Do List. You already dedicate time \nto work (including working as a stay-at-home parent), school, parenting responsibilities, \nand other roles (e.g., youth soccer coach, church council, volunteer work) that populate \nyour daily schedule. The Daily To-Do List helps you to reserve time for priority tasks in \nthe precious open slots in your day. Then again, even relatively light, unstructured days \nbenefit from the use of a Daily To-Do List to ensure that desired tasks\u2014including recre-\national tasks\u2014are completed (see Table 2.1).\n\nTable 2.1.  Example of a Daily To-Do List\n9 \u2013 9:05 a.m.\u2013Return customer phone call\u2013Inform him that the quote I \ngave\u00a0him is the lowest I can offer.\n1 \u2013 1:30 p.m.\u2013Make calls to prospective new customers.

A three-level \nhierarchy can be used to identify high-, medium-, or low-priority tasks, with some peo-\nple using color-coding to identify different levels of priority (e.g., green, yellow, red). \nThe four quadrant approach in which tasks are assessed in terms of their ratings (high \nvs. low) on the domains of urgency and importance provides an externalized format for \nassessing the relative priority of tasks (Covey, Merrill, & Merrill, 1994). The goal of the \nquadrant model is to expend most effort on those tasks high in importance but low in \nurgency (i.e., Quadrant II), which is a rubric used in Mary Solanto\u2019s (2011) group cogni-\ntive behavioral therapy approach for adult ADHD.

One of the challenges of ADHD is \ninhibiting the impulse to do something else that is more interesting but less important \nthan what you set out to do.\n\nEntering the room with a plan entails reminding yourself of your reason for entering \na room, store, or opening a computer file, or any other action that is part of your imme-\ndiate task plan. Getting something you need for a project or switching between tasks are \nvulnerable times during which you are prone to distraction, such as catching a glance of \nsomething else that needs to be done. Entering the room with a plan gives you a target to \nget past a risky situation, such as being tempted to click on the Internet icon when open-\ning a computer file you need for a work project (e.g., \u201cI am going to work on the report \nuntil 1 p.m. and then I can \u2018play.\u2019\u201d). This coping reminder can also help you return to a \ntask when you find yourself digressing aimlessly at home or at the office at times that you \nwant to be productive (\u201cI came downstairs to get paper for the printer. I will get it and \ngo back upstairs to finish my work.\u201d).\n\nIn  this  vein,  it  is  crucial  to  anticipate  common  triggers  for  distraction  and  escape \nfrom tasks, and to develop preemptive plans for dealing with them. For example, let\u2019s say \n\n\fTake Away 2.3. Daily To-Do List\n1.  Find an index card, back of an envelope, or other disposable piece \n\n2.

Your Daily To-Do List is made up of tasks you want to do that are not \npart of your typical schedule but that require a special investment of \ntime and effort to complete.\n\n4.

The To-Do List\n\nyou set out to work at your desk but anticipate that coworkers will stop by to invite you \nto get coffee or that you get an e-mail that offers an excuse to stop working. There is \nresearch to suggest that coming up with an \u201cif-then\u201d plan for managing these possible \ninterruptions will increase the likelihood you will stay on task (Gawrilow, 2011), that is, \n\u201cIf someone invites me to get coffee, then I will thank him but say that I must keep work-\ning on this project\u201d or \u201cIf I see an interesting e-mail, then I will remind myself that I can \nread it after I finish my time on the task.\u201d Making these implementation plans explicit \nincreases the likelihood of effective follow-through.\n\nReturning  to  the  definition  of  ADHD  as  characterized  by  difficulties  organizing \nbehavior across time, it stands to reason that you need a tool that helps you to bring \ntogether and orchestrate various tasks and obligations over the course of a day, week, \nand month. The Daily Planner is a tool and a process to manage the tasks identified on \nTo-Do Lists and to fit them in within the context of other demands of your daily life. \nAlthough it is a distinct coping skill that will be discussed in the next chapter, the Daily \nPlanner  represents  the  final  step  in  the \u201cTo-Do  List\u201d  domain  of  coping  strategies  for \nadult ADHD.\n\n\f3 How Do You Spend Yourself?\n\nThe Daily Planner\n\nAs we will repeat throughout this handbook, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n(ADHD)  is  not  a  knowledge  deficit  but  rather  a  performance  deficit  insofar  as  it  is \ndifficult for adults with ADHD to convert intentions into actions. The previous chap-\nter focused on the issue of identifying, organizing, and prioritizing various plans into \nmanageable tasks and keeping track of them using a portable Daily To-Do List. The \ncurrent chapter focuses on the Daily Planner as a tool for defining times in one\u2019s day, \nweek, or month that are designated for action on your objectives, as well as to arrange \nall of your obligations and commitments.\n\nWhen you think about it, the Daily Planner is a simple tool. Fundamentally, any plan-\nner is composed of a series of empty columns and rows, with the columns representing \na single day and the rows representing increments of time within that day. This straight-\nforward format lets you survey all that must be done and provides you with a sense of \nthe \u201cflow\u201d of your day. These rows and columns serve as containers for time and allow \nyou to strategize how you want to spend these increments of time.\n\nIt is recommended that the Daily Planner become your companion throughout the \nday.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04c30d1a-238d-4718-9135-f25437bfea41": {"__data__": {"id_": "04c30d1a-238d-4718-9135-f25437bfea41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7de7996f-fb44-4614-aede-62d0ddfc42fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cabcf26c02b97a04dbecf471f1aee4fea194a615557924c4951765ca93d2746a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3028ecc-7602-405a-b592-64629c9f060d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "80c88aa89b28f9bdf4ea6bbbf448841e17abd7ab28d59635ac28b5fa93f76949"}}, "hash": "d95418a4adfba256445b2e7e1b134ba4a0ebd47e3b88f38f0e25f3f7224b6c96", "text": "It is recommended that the Daily Planner become your companion throughout the \nday.  As  with  many  other  coping  strategies  focused  on  externalizing  information,  the \nDaily Planner is similar to a flash drive or the cloud for your brain, a device that offers \nmore memory capacity than is provided by your neural circuitry. The process involved \nin  developing  the  Daily  To-Do  List  and  entering  it  into  the  Daily  Planner  represents \ncognitive rehearsal of the coming day and helps with its encoding, although the main \nbenefit of having a record of your daily schedule is that you can refer to it throughout \nthe day and do not have to remember what needs to be done.\n\nThere  are  several  aspects  of  using  the  Daily  Planner  that  will  help  you  make  an \ninformed choice about a system that will be most helpful to you. Likewise, there are \nseveral suggestions for getting the most out of your Daily Planner that will be discussed \nbelow. The first step in using a Daily Planner, however, is choosing a Daily Planner.\n\nChoosing a Daily Planner\n\nIt would seem as though the choice of a Daily Planner system is as easy as going to the \nnearest office supply store or simply tapping the calendar feature on your smartphone. \nAs with most aspects of coping with ADHD, however, it is important to take a pause and \nmake an informed decision about the type of system that will work best for you and that \nyou will use over the long haul.\n\n\f20 The Daily Planner\n\nThe first choice about a Daily Planner boils down to \u201cpaper or digital.\u201d Do you pre-\nfer a traditional daily calendar, such as a spiral-bound appointment book, or using the \ncalendar feature on an electronic device that can be synchronized with your computer? \nBoth options are feasible, but the deciding factors should be the format that will be most \nportable and convenient to use, and will serve its fundamental purpose: to provide a \nmeans to record and track your daily plan.\n\nAt first blush, it would seem that the digital version wins this argument, hands down. \nThat is, smartphones, computer tablets, and/or other electronic devices already have an \nestablished place alongside wallets, keys, purses, and so on as the essential \u201ctools of daily \nlife.\u201d These gadgets are convenient, portable, and have alarms that provide important \nreminders.\n\nOur observation over our years of working with many adults with ADHD, how-\never, is that despite all these benefits, digital calendars are underutilized as a coping \ntool  for  ADHD.  People  generally  do  not  reference  their  smartphone  or  computer \ntablet calendar enough during the day, and we hear the lament, \u201cI had it in my phone, \nbut  did  not  check  it.\u201d Alarm  systems  can  be  used  as  reminders  for  tasks,  but  these \nare imperfect. An alarm that goes off 30 minutes before a scheduled meeting is not \nhelpful if you are in a shopping mall 60 minutes away from where you will need to \nbe. Moreover, multiple alarms on a smartphone have become akin to car alarms\u2014\nwe hear them go off but are desensitized to them and ignore them. That said, some \npeople are \u201cwired in and synched up\u201d throughout the day, and they make good use \nof electronic calendars, though this still seems to be only a small minority of adults \nwith ADHD we see.\n\nTraditional  paper  Daily  Planners  offer  an  easy-to-use  format  that  is  simpler  to \naccess than a digital calendar. In addition to being able to quickly grab and open a \nplanner, it can be referred to during the day to see \u201cwhat is next\u201d or can lay flat on \na desk where you can glance at it. You are able to see your day, week, or month in a \nsingle view rather than having to scroll through several small screens. We mentioned \nearlier that writing entries in your planner helps encode this information. Likewise, \nglancing at a record of upcoming tasks helps \u201cprime\u201d you for action.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3028ecc-7602-405a-b592-64629c9f060d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3028ecc-7602-405a-b592-64629c9f060d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "04c30d1a-238d-4718-9135-f25437bfea41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d95418a4adfba256445b2e7e1b134ba4a0ebd47e3b88f38f0e25f3f7224b6c96"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bce352e-ff37-4466-bcaf-bd4c0551cdc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db1263b22ad9038b0e3a94f0ce636da2effba6f70cc88ec471758cdd43c3db5a"}}, "hash": "80c88aa89b28f9bdf4ea6bbbf448841e17abd7ab28d59635ac28b5fa93f76949", "text": "The Daily Plan-\nner also provides a diary of sorts inasmuch as you have a collection of past schedules \nthat can be referred to when necessary (e.g., \u201cWhen was the last time I had the car in \nfor an oil change?\u201d).\n\nThe drawback of the paper Daily Planner is that it can be forgotten, misplaced, or \nlost, which is also a risk for electronic devices. Size and portability are important con-\nsiderations, and the planner should provide adequate space in which to log your com-\nmitments.

Russell Ramsay and Anthony L. Rostain, Routledge\n\n\f22 The Daily Planner\n\n(Over)use It or Lose It\n\nWe discussed the choice of what type of Daily Planner you will use. Whatever system you \ndecide on, it is important to remember that something is better than nothing. The ulti-\nmate benefit of the Daily Planner depends on how you use it in your daily life. As with \nbuying a gym membership, you must use it to attain the desired results.\n\nEven  among  ADHD  adults  who  consistently  use  a  Daily  Planner,  it  is  still  often \n underutilized. The Daily Planner is not only for use for professional appointments or \ndates  for  exams  in  school,  but  also  to  be  used  to  help  you  to  manage  your  personal, \nsocial, recreational, and other discretionary time and activities throughout each day.\n\nThe planner provides scaffolding with which to plan and organize your day. Rather than \n\u201cwinging it,\u201d it is essential to schedule times for tasks, including reserving time for basic \nneeds, such as meals, sleep, and other self-care tasks. In fact, including these sorts of activi-\nties in your schedule helps you appreciate how much time and effort these tasks require.\n\nSelf-Care Activities\n\nAs we alluded to above, it is important to consider self-care, including your health and well-\nbeing, as prioritized tasks, such as exercise, reading, hobbies, and simple downtime. You \nmay think that these are the \u201ceasy\u201d tasks that already take up too much of your time and \nthat you need to focus on more productive tasks. Yes, you are more likely to procrastinate \non important obligations that are not immediately reinforcing.

We do not want you to give \nup enjoyable activities but rather to be more mindful about how they fit into your day and \nto be proactive in reserving time for them as rewards for time spent on other tasks.\n\nAn aspect of the choreography of your schedule is managing your energy and effort. \nIt is vital to schedule breaks throughout the day, including time for meals or exercise, \netc. A side effect of the distraction and poor self-monitoring features of ADHD is that \nyou may not notice signals that you are hungry, tired, or other cues about your current \nphysical state that affect functioning. Reserving time for self-care provides stop gaps to \nmake sure you attend to your well-being.\n\nOne of the barriers to prioritizing self-care is the thought, \u201cI cannot think about exercise \nwhen I have so much to do\u201d (or the more punitive thought, \u201cI mismanaged my time earlier \nin the day and therefore I cannot justify allowing myself to still exercise.\u201d). We view \u201cself-\ncare\u201d (including recreational) tasks as crucial to promoting follow-through on other \u201cwork\u201d \nand \u201cschool\u201d tasks or any other important obligations. Rather than \u201cwasting time,\u201d self-care \nis essential to promoting overall well-being and efficiency. There will be times, of course, \nwhen a situation dictates that you sacrifice a self-care task for another priority (e.g., \u201cI will \nhave to skip my downtime on the Internet tonight in order to prepare for my presentation \ntomorrow.\u201d). For the most part, however, it is beneficial to maintain self-care behaviors and \nto not deny yourself the advantages that sleep, exercise, and healthy diet provide.\n\nErr on the Side of Underscheduling\n\nAt the same time we promote overutilizing your Daily Planner, we encourage you to err \non the side of underscheduling. In the spirit of \u201cstarting small,\u201d when in doubt, sched-\nule fewer rather than more tasks and give yourself more buffer time between tasks and \n\n\fThe Daily Planner 23\n\nappointments  than  may  seem  necessary,  at  least  as  you  become  accustomed  to  your \nDaily Planner. Executive function deficits make it more difficult for you to gauge and \nmonitor how much time it takes to perform tasks, how much transition time is needed \nbetween tasks, and what constitutes your realistic pace throughout the day. Thus, it is \nbetter to start small and gradually build up your schedule.\n\nWe propose a \u201cless-is-more\u201d mindset, at least at the outset of using the Daily Planner. \nSimilar to the notion of setting limits on the number of items on the Daily To-Do List to \navoid becoming overwhelmed, allow yourself time to become familiar with the planner \nand the pace and choreography of your day. It will take some time and effort for you to \ndevelop the habit of consistently using the planner and finding the right choreography \nof tasks, and your pace for completing them. Remember, you are not only managing \ntime and tasks, but your effort and energy as well.\n\nDefine Start and End Times for Tasks\n\nMany tasks and meetings have discrete (or at least reasonably predictable) start and end \ntimes, such as college classes, meetings at work, church services, television programs, a \ntime-based exercise routine (e.g., yoga class, 30 minutes on treadmill), and so on. These \nsorts of activities are easier to schedule and maneuver around other commitments in \nyour Daily Planner because they are time bound.\n\nMany  projects  do  not  have  such  defined  time  commitments. You  may  plan  to  do \nsome housework or work on a paper for a class, but no one else will know if you do not \nend up following through on these tasks. It is easy to rationalize that \u201cI can work on this \nlater.\u201d In fact, if you do work on it later, then it is not a problem.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77fbef24-116a-4f1d-b83b-aba28dc8c529": {"__data__": {"id_": "77fbef24-116a-4f1d-b83b-aba28dc8c529", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bce352e-ff37-4466-bcaf-bd4c0551cdc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db1263b22ad9038b0e3a94f0ce636da2effba6f70cc88ec471758cdd43c3db5a"}, "3": {"node_id": "43a63c36-f66c-4a38-8f1e-3a0f4de382f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0eeb552571abfc8810c700cdb52fefa442034e3533a4ade77391d9f34f48730c"}}, "hash": "5a0f81c25eb4f6fab0ee6a70582d323dc9ed12aa69871858732bb38ec6bcaaa4", "text": "However, most adults \nwith ADHD describe putting off tasks until they are facing either a time deadline, such \nas the due date for a project, or an untenable situation, such as not having any clean \nclothes, or a room reaching an upsetting level of disorganization and clutter.\n\nTasks without definitive endpoints are more challenging to plan.

It is the same with tasks entered in the Daily Planner\u2014\nit is helpful to know when they start as well as when they will end as a means to adjust \nexpectations in order to promote follow-through.\n\nMany adults with ADHD declare that they \u201cwork best at the last minute,\u201d but the peo-\nple who seek out help for ADHD have usually encountered significant problems stem-\nming from this pattern of \u201cbrinksmanship.\u201d Even if you are able to pull an \u201call-nighter\u201d \nor spend marathon sessions catching up on work or chores (which is romanticized as \n\u201chyperfocus\u201d), these strategies come at a cost to you and your physical and emotional \nwell-being. Establishing end times for tasks helps guard against the risk of falling into this \ncrisis pattern.\n\nUsing the format of the Daily Planner, a coping strategy you can use for open-ended \ntasks is to schedule realistic start and end times. Projects such as working on a research \npaper for college, a presentation for work, or cleaning up and organizing a room at home \ncan be daunting, and several hours can be spent on any one of these important tasks \n\n\f24 The Daily Planner\n\nwithout reaching completion. Although these are exactly the sorts of tasks for which you \nwant to reserve time in your Daily Planner, there will likely never be an adequate chunk \nof time to complete them in one sitting. In fact, even if you do have an open schedule \nwithout any commitments, it is not likely that you or anyone will schedule and follow-\nthrough on an 8-hour block of time devoted to \u201cclean and organize my bedroom\u201d or \n\u201cwrite the assigned 20-page paper.\u201d You do not devote that much time to activities you \nenjoy, much less a chore or an assignment.\n\nThe  notion  of  scheduling  start  and  end  times  for  projects,  first  and  foremost,  is \nmeant  to  set  realistic  and  achievable  expectations  for  task  performance,  particularly \nthose that are not naturally enjoyable or \u201cmotivating.\u201d Using the example from above, \nyou may not be able to commit to 8 hours of cleaning up a room, but you will be able \nto handle 30 minutes. You are still working on a chore, but you are narrowing your \nfocus and expectations by defining an increment of time for a task that is manageable \nand helps you to get engaged in a productive activity. This coping strategy is another \nspecific step involved in \u201cbreaking down tasks\u201d to make them more doable. Rather than \nattempting to raise your motivation for the task, you can \u201clower the bar\u201d and set a more \nreasonable expectation.\n\nA second benefit of having start and end times is that it makes it easier to schedule \ntasks, which, in turn, promotes follow-through. These tasks are probably the sort that \nyou will want to include on your Daily To-Do List. This approach is particularly helpful \nwhen working on a large undertaking that cannot be completed all at once. You define a \nspecific part of the project to work on during a specified block of time, which allows you \nto make headway without becoming overwhelmed (and then procrastinating).\n\nLastly, the use of start and end times for tasks is a useful way to handle days in which \nyou have a great deal of discretionary time, such as a vacation day or a weekend. This is \nnot to say that you must be \u201cproductive\u201d all day and scheduled in each available block \nof time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43a63c36-f66c-4a38-8f1e-3a0f4de382f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "43a63c36-f66c-4a38-8f1e-3a0f4de382f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "77fbef24-116a-4f1d-b83b-aba28dc8c529", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a0f81c25eb4f6fab0ee6a70582d323dc9ed12aa69871858732bb38ec6bcaaa4"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f2e1e5b-5538-47ed-9f60-d365c3b68852", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a589173fb11244e63fa6190d003492601afbd2221ccb8a5811217f052f4b37d"}}, "hash": "0eeb552571abfc8810c700cdb52fefa442034e3533a4ade77391d9f34f48730c", "text": "However, this approach helps to define some reasonable tasks (including rec-\nreation and downtime) that provide anchors during the day and to guard against the \nexperience of reaching the end of a \u201cfree day\u201d and feeling that it was wasted.\n\nYou may be thinking that \u201cI have used lists and calendars before but still did not fol-\nlow them.\u201d You are correct that the Daily Planner is a tool, and it must be used in order \nto  achieve  benefits.

The \nnext chapter will focus in more detail on the use of the Daily Planner to promote time \nand task management and the implementation of your plans.\n\n\f4 Define, Prioritize, and Choreograph  \n\nWhat You Do\nTime and Task Management\n\nOnce you have a sense of your Comprehensive To-Do List, your prioritized Daily To-Do \nList, and a Daily Planner system, you have the basic tools with which to manage your \ntime, tasks, effort, and energy. Akin to learning to play chess, while understanding the \nrules of the game and the defined moves for each of the pieces is essential, there is the \ndistinct skill of playing the game and contending with an opponent. In a similar fashion, \nyou may have developed many ornate lists and well-designed plans in the past but did \nnot keep to them. Thus, it is in how you play the time management game that deter-\nmines how well you manage your Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). \nThis chapter will focus on the time management \u201cmoves\u201d and tactics that will help you \nto put together the different skills and tools we have discussed thus far in order to follow \nthrough on plans.\n\nReview the Daily Planner\u2014Early and Often\n\nOne of the principles we mentioned early in this handbook is the need to transform \ncoping strategies into routine habits in your daily life. One of the foundational habits \nis the regular use and review of the Daily Planner, which is ideally done in tandem with \nmaking the Daily To-Do List.\n\nWe recommend that you establish specific times dedicated to sitting down, setting up, \nand tracking your plan for the day. Most people find that spending a 10-minute block \nof time either at the beginning or end of their day (or both) helps establish the habit of \nthinking through the plan and recording it in the Daily Planner. A stay-at-home parent \nmay plan out a day the night before; an office worker often can start a work day by sit-\nting down at his desk and setting out the day\u2019s agenda; and workers whose jobs are more \nfluid, such as salespeople or contractors, often have to revise their plans throughout the \nday in order to accommodate opportunities that pop up. Time spent planning is also a \ngood way to decide how to make use of unstructured or discretionary time. For example, \nit is beneficial to think through how you want to use your weekend or a 2-hour break \nbetween classes, either for recreation or to run errands that are tough to fit in during a \ntypical day.\n\nWe recommend at least 10 minutes\u2014an honest 600 seconds\u2014for these daily plan-\nning sessions. We say an \u201chonest\u201d 10 minutes/600 seconds to point out that planning \nrequires at least several minutes to accomplish adequately instead of the more common \nuse of \u201c10 minutes\u201d to suggest an imprecise, but brief, time (e.g., \u201cGive me 10 minutes to \n\n\f26 Time and Task Management\n\ntake care of things and then I\u2019ll stop by your office\u201d). Such a time frame is short enough \nthat it is feasible, yet it provides you enough time for this crucial step in your day. You \nwill soon find that this 10-minute investment reaps dividends by saving time and effort \nthroughout the day that would otherwise be lost to scrambling to address problems that \ncould have been avoided.\n\nThe  Daily  Planner  is  designed  to  be  referenced  throughout  the  day,  allowing  you \nto repeatedly revisit your plan and to keep you on track.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f2e1e5b-5538-47ed-9f60-d365c3b68852": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f2e1e5b-5538-47ed-9f60-d365c3b68852", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "43a63c36-f66c-4a38-8f1e-3a0f4de382f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0eeb552571abfc8810c700cdb52fefa442034e3533a4ade77391d9f34f48730c"}, "3": {"node_id": "5fcb0ba6-74b0-4b1a-813b-6db9eeff7530", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7a34f4eef77f3b8843df7f2d4d85424990fe950bfa0ecee46df4b5b4bdecac6"}}, "hash": "8a589173fb11244e63fa6190d003492601afbd2221ccb8a5811217f052f4b37d", "text": "You should be glancing at it \nthroughout the day to see what you have completed, make adjustments to your plans \n(if needed) and remind yourself of what is coming up later that day, in the evening, or \nlater that week. This habit allows you to keep tabs on your time and tasks in manageable \nincrements and to identify some useful anchor points throughout the day that can help \nyou to pace yourself as you move from task to task (e.g., \u201cI will finish working on this \nproject and then I have a lunch break.\u201d).\n\nAs your Daily Planner assumes its place among your \u201ctools of daily life\u201d (i.e., keys, cell \nphone, wallet, purse, etc.), you will use it to schedule upcoming commitments, such as \nsocial events, exams, meetings, appointments, etc. as they arise. In addition to organiz-\ning your day, the time spent thinking about and planning your activities is a \u201cpriming\u201d \nactivity that increases the likelihood of behavioral follow-through.\n\nWrite Down All of Your Existing Obligations\n\nThe best way to get started using your Daily Planner is to populate that day\u2019s schedule \nwith all of your existing obligations for that day, even if they seem obvious and routine. \nYour Daily Planner is akin to a financial budget with a daily account of 24 hours to be \n\u201cspent.\u201d Your  existing  obligations  represent  standard  expenses,  such  as  utilities,  taxes, \netc. that are deducted from your budget. Thus, time in classes, meetings at work, pick-\nup times from preschool, yoga class, etc. all are entered into your Planner to represent \ndeductions from your 24 hours.\n\nThinking through the flow of your day and your different roles is another way to \nrecognize all that you already get done, which adults with ADHD often underestimate. \nCommitments such as a meeting with a teacher at school, an errand to run for your \nchurch or synagogue, picking up a package at the post office, attending a review ses-\nsion at school, or a scheduled meeting at work all belong in the planner. Make sure to \ninclude planned exercise, \u201cappointment television,\u201d or a planned get-together with a \nfriend. Remember to account for travel times and to reserve time for basic self-care, \nnamely  the  morning  wake-up  routine,  meals,  various  household  chores,  and  sleep. \nThe Daily Planner is a coping tool that externalizes time and allows you to see how all \nof your tasks and obligations fit together rather than relying on your \u201csense\u201d of time, \nwhich is often faulty.\n\nSome  day\u2019s  schedules  will  include  obligations  specific  to  a  particular  day  of  the \nweek, such as attending religious services, a weekly exercise class, or a standing volun-\nteer commitment. Of course, the Daily Planner is a useful tool for keeping track of less \nfrequent, stand-alone obligations, such as semiannual dental or medical visits, meeting \nwith an accountant during tax season, parent-teacher conferences, or other professional \nappointments.\n\n\fTake Away 4.1.

Rostain, Routledge\n\n\f28 Time and Task Management\n\nDefine Tasks for Your Daily To-Do List\n\nAfter establishing the main obligations and tasks in your day, it is important to coordi-\nnate your schedule with your Daily To-Do List, the portable record of specific priority \ntasks for that day. Items on your Daily To-Do List can be scheduled in your Daily Plan-\nner, such as running a special errand or devoting time to an important project for work \nor school. For example, you may have a standing 2 p.m. class each Monday that is listed \nin your Daily Planner as an obligation, but you need not put that on your Daily To-Do \nList. If you are scheduled to make a presentation in the next meeting of that class, how-\never, you can reserve the break before that class in your Planner for your final prepara-\ntions, which is a task entered on the Daily To-Do List.\n\nThe Daily Planner is akin to the Google Maps feature in which you can start with a \nwide view of the general area and the route you will take. Similar to the map feature, you \ncan telescope in on progressively more detailed views of individual weeks, days, and por-\ntions of a single day. The Daily To-Do List becomes the street level view in which, after \ndefining the time of day it will be performed, you arrive at that task for performance \nusing step-by-step directions. Of course, as with good directions, it is important to have \nuseful and accurate steps for these tasks, which we discuss next.\n\nBreaking Down a Task into Its Steps\n\nThere are a series of philosophical problems known as Zeno\u2019s paradoxes. One of them \nsays that as you attempt to leave a room, you must first reach the midpoint between \nyou and the exit. As you continue toward the doorway, you will again reach the new \nmidpoint, with each successive attempt to exit the room requiring you to reach the next \nmidpoint. The paradox is that you should be unable to leave a room because you can \ninfinitely halve the distance to the exit without ever getting out of the room.\n\nYou may often feel like you are the person trying to leave the room when facing tasks \non your Daily To-Do List inasmuch as it seems as though you can never get them started. \nWe use the Zeno\u2019s paradox example to illustrate that most tasks you will encounter can \nbe broken down into ever-smaller component steps. More importantly, taking the right \nfirst step on a task gives you the sense that \u201cI can do this,\u201d a seemingly small matter that \nholds big rewards.\n\nWhen setting out your priority tasks, you will encounter some undertakings that acti-\nvate a sense of dread, an overwhelmed feeling, or thoughts that you cannot deal with \nthem. Rather than automatically avoiding them (\u201cI can\u2019t handle this now!\u201d), the first \nstep is to consider what you want to accomplish and if your task, at least as you currently \nthink of it, is too big or vague.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6738ad2b-afeb-4b04-a45b-70a5d5e1bc0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6738ad2b-afeb-4b04-a45b-70a5d5e1bc0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fcb0ba6-74b0-4b1a-813b-6db9eeff7530", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7a34f4eef77f3b8843df7f2d4d85424990fe950bfa0ecee46df4b5b4bdecac6"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d4e4e39-1062-4724-80f3-87a142928822", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b846f2bc5a43d1257cfb5d72e24e29fa5b5d0c06914adf63128827e61be3931"}}, "hash": "aab11122f895bc0d484d2652585ec2d59559f9017631edebf69bd66535802b27", "text": "The overall objective is still important, such as \u201corganize \nmy room\u201d or \u201cwork on paper for school,\u201d but framed in such broad terms it is hard to \npicture a way to get started.\n\nAs with the example of leaving a room, you can divide the large project into its compo-\nnent steps. Thus, \u201corganize my room\u201d is broken down into the separate tasks of removing \nclutter that does not belong in the room, deciding what items will stay in the room, and \nidentifying where each of these items will be stored. Even the first step of removing clut-\nter might be too stressful. If that is the case, this step can be shrunk down to focus on a \n\n\fTime and Task Management 29\n\nspecific item, such as \u201cI will start by picking up any dishes in my room and take them to \nthe kitchen.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a work or school project is comprised of different steps. There may be data \nthat need to be compiled or analyzed before delving into the monthly report write-up. \nTime spent organizing one\u2019s thoughts or outlining a paper is a helpful way for a student \nto begin a project without having to jump right into writing. Even once you have started \nyour write-up, you may procrastinate on getting back to the unfinished paper. The goal \nof \u201ccontinue to write the report\u201d seems daunting, so, an initial, smaller step toward this \nend can be framed as \u201cI will read the last paragraph I wrote and I will then write the first \nsentence of the next paragraph.\u201d\n\nThe  principles  to  remember  here  are  to  define  the  task  in  simple  and  behavioral \nterms in order to turn the task objective into an action you can perform. You will be \nable to find a way to reduce most tasks into the smallest, behavioral first step that you \nfeel capable to perform in order to overcome procrastination. A straightforward way to \nfirst \u201ctouch\u201d many work and school projects is to make sure you have accurate informa-\ntion about the parameters of the task, due date, etc. (e.g., \u201cI will check the syllabus to \nmake sure I am clear about the assignment.\u201d). Simply opening the computer file for a \nwork project or picking up the textbook to be read for a class represent simple action \nsteps that greatly increase the likelihood of taking a next step on the task (see Table 4.1).\nTime  spent  visualizing  and  planning  the  task  itself  represents  a  small  first  step  of \nengagement and is an exposure exercise that fosters your ability to face something that \nyou typically avoid and escape. A spreadsheet, a sheet of paper, or index cards can be \nused to tease apart the different steps of a large project steps, including your start point, \nthe desired end point, and all the steps in between. This exercise is particularly beneficial \nwhen a task is large and has a future deadline. This sort of project requires \u201cdoing a little \nbit\u201d each day rather than being stuck doing everything at the last minute in a panic. Even \nif you plan to devote an hour or two on a single day to a task, such as chores, errands, or \nyard work, it is useful to have a plan for breaking down and ordering your steps (includ-\ning a reward). Breaking a task down into a manageable step is an essential strategy to \nhelp you to get started and to stay on track.\n\nTable 4.1.

Rostain, Routledge\n\n\fTime and Task Management 31\n\nCommuting and Other Buffer Times\n\nWhen ordering coffee, the barista may ask, \u201cDo you want room for cream?\u201d If your cup \nis filled to the rim, you will not have enough room to prepare your drink to your liking \nand will likely end up spilling it. Likewise, it is easier to begin with a modest schedule and \nthen add tasks than it is to have an overly ambitious plan and running the risk of becom-\ning overwhelmed by having too much to do\u2014and ultimately not doing any of it. Hence, \nit is important to leave adequate time between tasks when making your daily schedule.\n\nCommuting  time  offers  a  good  example  of  the  buffer  time  principle.  Our ADHD \nprogram is located in the wonderful city of Philadelphia. One of the few things not so \nwonderful about Philadelphia is the traffic and parking situation. When helping people \nreview their daily plans that involve navigating the roadways of the Greater Philadel-\nphia area, we see that people fall into the \u201c60 mile-per-hour\u201d planning error. That is, \nwhen  scheduling  an  appointment  that  involves,  say,  a  15-mile  drive  to  the  office,  the \nassumption is, \u201cIt will take me about 15 minutes to get to the appointment,\u201d based on \nthe 1-mile-per-minute calculation when traveling at highway speed. However, this cal-\nculation involves the assumption that the person will leave home on time, will get into a \ncar already moving at highway speed, will maintain that rate the entire trip (unimpeded \nby traffic, stoplights, or weather), and will find open parking at the front door of the \noffice building before stepping directly into a waiting elevator in the lobby. Not only is \nthere no room for error, but this plan goes against any reasonable expectation of driving \nconditions in and around Philly (or most anywhere else). This mindset is an example of \nhow \u201cpositive thinking\u201d is not necessarily adaptive. In fact, this situation usually stems \nless from a positive bias than it does from disregarding all the factors that necessitate \nfactoring in buffer time.\n\nA useful piece of advice for calculating buffer times was provided to us when discuss-\ning this topic with one of our patients who owned a boat. He said that a guideline used \nby boat owners to help them set realistic expectations for how long maintenance and \nrepairs to their crafts will take is, \u201cHowever long you think the job will take, double the \nnumber and add an increment of time.\u201d Thus, if you think a boat repair will take 2 hours, \nplan for it to take 4 days; if you think it will take 4 days, expect it will take 8 weeks, etc.\n\nAlthough not meant to be followed literally, the spirit of the idea is that it is a useful \npractice to err on the side of allowing more rather than less time for commuting or other \ntasks for which people do not often calculate how long they require.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0ad2325-2713-4c27-ab1e-a546f0e02d68": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0ad2325-2713-4c27-ab1e-a546f0e02d68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d4e4e39-1062-4724-80f3-87a142928822", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b846f2bc5a43d1257cfb5d72e24e29fa5b5d0c06914adf63128827e61be3931"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6cbd38d-fec4-4093-bee9-68de710ec76a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "925f88e2e6f48ca1c068ff92cf0eb3e70330e03f4c03ba12052e2ec755f513cc"}}, "hash": "f97eef3488c0d3fc319a2dea9a085a066f1597ecafc302ea08f45a5381da7d9c", "text": "Activities such as the \nmorning routine for getting ready for work, various household chores, food shopping, \ntime spent sitting in the waiting room before seeing a physician, etc. often take up more \ntime than we anticipate. In fact, it is a useful experiment to actually use a timer to get \nan accurate sense of how long these tasks really take in order make more realistic plans.\n\nScheduling Unstructured, Discretionary, and Downtime\n\nPeople often underutilize their Daily Planners. These planners are viewed as tools solely \nfor keeping track of academic or work obligations, or professional appointments. While \nthese engagements are important to record, the Daily Planner can be used to manage all \nthe remaining slots in your day. This is not meant to imply that you must be obsessively \nand  completely  scheduled  with  obligations  or  productive  tasks  from  morning  until \n\n\f32 Time and Task Management\n\nnight; rather, you can use the Planner to make informed decisions about how to make \nuse of your day, your time, and your energy\u2014how you \u201cspend yourself,\u201d to return to our \nfinancial budget metaphor.\n\nFor example, many of our patients say that they are more productive at work and \nschool when they use these time management and planning skills. When reaching the \nweekend  or  a  vacation  day,  however,  they  decide  that  they  will  go  with  the  flow  and \nview these days as not requiring a plan. By the time they have to go back to their regular \nschedule, they often describe feeling disappointed that they did not make better use of \ntheir free time, including recreational pursuits. ADHD adults who work from home or \notherwise set up their own schedule, such as a graduate student working on a thesis, \nface the unique situation of having priority work tasks to complete without having the \nexternal organizational scaffolding provided by a work or school schedule.\n\nThe same strategies that improve efficiency during the work week are also helpful \nwhen planning weekends or other unstructured time. The Daily Planner is used to plan \nthe \u201cflow of the day\u201d when working from home, to make use of free time in the midst of \na typical work/school day, or to make plans for days off. When planning work at home, it \nis important to define specific projects to which to devote time that day, and better still, \nwhen you define specific and behavioral To-Do tasks connected to these projects. Each \nof the steps can then be performed within realistic time frames, including a start time \nand end time for these tasks. In a similar fashion, making plans for weekend activities \nhelps ensure that you will have enough recreational and social activities, as well as taking \ncare of a few errands in order to feel that you are on top of things.\n\nWe are big believers in scheduling downtime. It is important to protect time for things \nthat  you  find  enjoyable,  relaxing,  and  regenerative,  which  help  reward  your  follow-\nthrough on other tasks. Hence, you may decide to spend the hour while your child is \nhaving her music lesson sitting in your car with your eyes closed, or playing a game on \nyour computer tablet. Breaks in your day can also be used to take care of nagging chores, \nto study in the library between classes, or to exercise. Discretionary time at work can be \nused to catch up on e-mails or other administrative tasks that are not priorities at other \ntimes. At home, you may spend some downtime surfing the Internet, watching television, \nor otherwise \u201cvegging out\u201d (see Table 4.2).\n\nWe like the phrase used in reference to vitamins and minerals in breakfast cereal ads: \n\u201crecommended daily allowance.\u201d A well-balanced daily schedule includes your \u201crecom-\nmended daily allowance\u201d of work, school, and other obligations, but it is important to have \nenough time for exercise, hobbies, downtime, etc. to maintain your overall well-being.\n\nChoreography and Realistic Expectations\n\nThe movie Apollo 13 was a dramatized account of a manned space mission to the Moon \nin 1970 that was abandoned in mid-flight due to mechanical difficulties.

Other people \nprefer to \u201cwarm up\u201d with lower priority administrative tasks at the start of the day before \nfacing higher-priority, more challenging tasks. Students learn that there are certain times \nduring the day that are better for them to focus on some academic tasks more than oth-\ners, such as devoting morning times for writing assignments and afternoons to assigned \nreadings. Similarly, certain pivot points during the day can be identified as good times \nfor certain mundane tasks, such as going through the mail as soon as you arrive home \nfrom work or catching up on e-mails for 15 minutes after returning from a lunch break \nat work.

Situations will inevitably arise that require you to adjust your expectations \nand your plans, such as leaving work to pick up a sick child from school or taking care \nof an emergency car repair. Apart from the logistics of reorganizing your schedule, the \nDaily Planner provides a coping tool for managing, or at least limiting the emotional \nstress that comes with unexpected changes. Referencing your Planner lets you see what \nchanges you must make and how to make them. There may be sacrifices that you will \nhave to make, such as skipping a trip to the gym or rescheduling an appointment in \norder to complete a project by a deadline. Having a record of your scheduled commit-\nments, however, provides a framework with which to deal with the situation by taking \nthe  necessary  steps  to  cancel  and  reschedule  meetings,  or  any  other  adjustments  that \nmust be made in order to effectively \u201cmanage the problem.\u201d\n\nIn addition to handling an unexpected change to your schedule, the Daily Planner \nhelps you to determine if the event was truly unexpected or if it resulted from procrasti-\nnation or underestimating the priority of certain tasks. These skills and systems provide \nyou with a more organized way to learn from mistakes and to decrease their recurrence.\n\nDo It Now\n\nThere is a saying that \u201ctime is nature\u2019s way to keep everything from happening all at once\u201d \n(attributed to the physicist John Archibald Wheeler). This quote encapsulates one of the \ngoals of the Daily Planner and the time and task management strategies\u2014to identify and \norganize the myriad responsibilities, commitments, and endeavors you face within the \nframework of the Daily Planner. Thus, you can focus on the task you want to perform at \n10 a.m. and strategically forget about the one you have scheduled for 4:30 p.m. because \nyou have it recorded and will get to it at its appointed time.\n\nRather  than  being  overwhelmed  by  everything  you  have  to  do,  the  Daily  Planner \nand Daily To-Do List provide placeholders for individual tasks. Your focus switches to \nengagement in the task, getting it done, and then getting it off the To-Do List. Breaking \ndown tasks into manageable, behavioral targets further increases the likelihood of follow-\nthrough. By doing so, you will experience the satisfaction of task completion, which is \npositive reinforcement for getting things done. These reward experiences create momen-\ntum that will increase your ability to follow through on endeavors that are meaningful.\n\nThe use of time and task management strategies provides a blueprint or recipe for \nfollow-through. However, similar to a blueprint or a recipe, if it is not followed, there \nis nothing to show for it. While you will likely notice improvements in your ability to \norganize and manage tasks, coping with adult ADHD requires ongoing diligence. It is \nnormal to encounter difficulties with the ongoing implementation of these skills and \nwith follow-through on tasks, akin to keeping up with an exercise routine. The next few \nchapters  address  the  common  difficulties  encountered  with  follow-through  on  plans, \nwith Chapter 5 focusing on overcoming procrastination.\n\n\f5\n\nPutting the Plan into Motion (or \u201cOnce I \nGet Started . . .\u201d)\n\nOn the television show Seinfeld, there was an episode in which Jerry was incredulous at \nbeing informed by a rental car agent that there were no more cars despite the fact he had \nmade a reservation.

And that\u2019s really the \nmost important part: the holding.\u201d Similarly, To-Do Lists and the Daily Planner represent \nintentions for your day.

But, you ultimately end up avoiding your main priority, altogether, despite your \nawareness that you will suffer the consequences. This is the very definition of procrasti-\nnation: \u201c[T]o procrastinate is to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite \nexpecting to be worse off for the delay\u201d (Steel, 2007, p. 66).\n\nIn  many  ways,  we  consider  procrastination  the  most  insidious  feature  of Attention- \nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), having referred to it as the cancer of ADHD. In \nfact, it can be considered the quintessential failure of self-regulation insofar as you put off \ndoing something despite knowing full well that you will suffer negative consequences. Pro-\ncrastination eats away at your plans, intentions, energy, and time, and leaves you with frus-\ntration and regret for lost opportunities. In this way, procrastination also interferes with the \nfulfillment of personal ambitions as well as important responsibilities, and therefore, it has \ncascading implications for your sense of self, not to mention any practical damages from \nmissed deadlines, incurring late fees and fines, effects on health, lost opportunities, etc.\n\nAs noted before, ADHD is characterized by problems developing, organizing, and enact-\ning plans in your life across time, particularly those for which there is not some sort of \nimmediate payoff or urgency attached. Thus, you will have to pay more attention to getting \nstarted on tasks in your Daily Planner than most other people. You know what you need \nto do, but you need to develop a better grasp for how you don\u2019t do things in order to more \neffectively tackle these barriers, which is the focus of this chapter. The first step is to make \nsure you have a clear idea of the steps you need to take to follow through on your plan.\n\nDefine Tasks in Specific, Behavioral Terms\n\nWhat is the precise task that you are avoiding? What are your automatic reactions to this \ntask? Is there another way to define the task to promote follow-through?\n\n\f36 Putting the Plan into Motion\n\nWe have discussed the benefit of defining a task or action you will perform in as specific \nand behavioral terms as possible. You may have items on your To-Do List or in your Daily \nPlanner, such as \u201cwork on monthly report,\u201d \u201cclean up kitchen,\u201d \u201cexercise,\u201d or \u201cdo readings \nfor Economics class.\u201d Some individuals can take these thumbnail descriptions and trans-\nlate them into action plans, such as using the plan to \u201cclean up kitchen\u201d as a prompt to first \nunload the dishwasher. However, individuals with ADHD have problems translating these \nbroadly defined tasks into a specific sequence of actions that promotes follow-through \n(e.g., \u201cThere is too much to do. I don\u2019t know where to start. I can\u2019t handle this now.\u201d).\n\nOn your Daily To-Do List or whenever carrying out such tasks, it is to your advantage \nto outline your plan in specific, behavioral terms or action steps that you can take. For \nlarger tasks that are comprised of multiple, smaller tasks, such as a monthly report or \ncleaning up a room, it is valuable to define a smaller, component step that gives you a \nmanageable target that gets you engaged.

Of \ncourse, we have all heard this advice and we know what we should do, but the point here \nis to script out how it will be done, including the smallest first step that bridges the gap \nbetween inaction and action.\n\nConversely, ongoing procrastination on a task can be a useful sign that you do not yet \nhave a clear starting point. The next section focuses on ways to define the crucial first \nstep that represents the difference between procrastination and engagement.\n\nDefine the Smallest Step of Behavioral Engagement\n\nDespite the previously mentioned strategies, you may still find yourself having difficul-\nties getting started on tasks. The sorts of tasks on which you continue to procrastinate \nare likely those for which you view even these small steps as being somewhat boring or \npainful, such as various chores, academic tasks (e.g., reading textbooks, writing assign-\nments), or administrative tasks of adult life (e.g., dealing with taxes, finances).\n\nThese and other tasks trigger negative thoughts and feelings for you that also interfere \nwith follow-through, even on initial steps. A way to get started on these tasks is to define \nin strict, behavioral steps the smallest behaviors that are required to start the task. These \ninitial behaviors may not involve actually completing the task, but they are necessary \nsteps and help you to \u201ctouch\u201d a task rather than keeping it at arm\u2019s length.\n\nThis  approach  is  meant  to  help  you  break  down  tasks  into  their  strict  behavioral \nsteps,  akin  to  a  recipe  for  cooking. You  may  say, \u201cI  do  not  know  how  to  cook\u201d  or \u201cI \ncannot do it.\u201d However, once you follow the specific steps, including \u201cget saucepan out \nof cupboard,\u201d \u201cfill with water,\u201d etc., you are now engaged in the task rather than being \ncognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally removed from it. It is an interesting exercise \nto see how other tasks that are typically avoided can be broken down into steps, such as a \nphone call (\u201cpick up phone receiver, enter the nine-digit phone number, wait for answer, \n\n\fPutting the Plan into Motion 37\n\nconverse in my native language . . .\u201d) or going to the gym (\u201cstand up, go to room and find \nworkout clothes, put in gym bag, . . .\u201d).\n\nFor example, a college student may have reading assignments for multiple classes. \nHe reserves 30 minutes in his schedule to devote to one of the readings, planning to get \nas far as he can in that time. However, he is still unable to pull himself away from the \ncomputer to start the reading despite knowing that it must be done. The first step of \nbehavioral engagement is to stop the task that interferes with the plan, and then take \nthe smallest step toward the target task. For the college student mentioned above, the \ntask becomes \u201cstand up and go pick up the textbook.\u201d The next step is defined as \u201copen \nto the first page of the chapter.\u201d The third step is, \u201cread the first sentence of the chapter,\u201d \nat which point the student is reading. Thus, he is no longer procrastinating. He may \nstop after the first sentence, or after 12 minutes, or he may continue reading for the \nfull 30 minutes (and beyond).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6c9c78d-a74c-4b74-8a69-81e0930f7bb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6c9c78d-a74c-4b74-8a69-81e0930f7bb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3df1f0c8-4554-4de8-9b60-4a8097b5e4a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "918d488448565db083aa1eb4c1ff83dbd95fa2cf9648906b84c742a8b4b7da3c"}, "3": {"node_id": "156df586-35b5-4119-98d5-4e24f1be0646", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "feace4489f06c2c797994ef75858110e16c8fd586573a02abd6e4df53ab8925e"}}, "hash": "50d8a6db86932ca7cc9223cb26c67601ddecd102709c8ea9b80f187140fcfeb5", "text": "Regardless of what happens next, at least the student has \nan action-based framework for facing procrastination instead of simply trying to \u201cnot \nprocrastinate.\u201d\n\nYou may react to this coping suggestion with the thought that \u201cThis is so basic, it will \nnot help me.\u201d If you are procrastinating on tasks, though, it is obvious that something \nin how you approach them is not working. Thus, it may seem absurd to have to handle \na phone call by defining a first step as \u201cpick up receiver\u201d or \u201cfind person in my contact \nlist,\u201d but most adults with ADHD have examples of task avoidance that are similarly \nabsurd (e.g., \u201cI can\u2019t believe I still have not made that phone call. I may have missed \nmy opportunity.\u201d). In fact, the purpose of the first step of behavioral engagement is to \nframe a task as such an absurdly simple action step that it becomes absurd to not do it.\nAn experiment we encourage you to perform is to simply monitor how you delay tasks \nthroughout your day in order to see how you do not do things. Of course, not all task \ndelays represent procrastination, but the experiment helps illustrate the process. It might \nbe as simple as not picking up a crumbled piece of paper on the floor that bounced off the \nedge of a trash can, not answering an incoming call on your cell phone, or something more \npersonally relevant, such as a work task or a workout. The exercise is designed to help you \nobserve the different thoughts, feelings, and escape behaviors that constitute your procras-\ntination profile. Procrastination is a habit that can become as reflexive as tying your shoes. \nHowever, the ability to recognize the signs of procrastination as they unfold helps to make \nthe process less automatic, provides you with cues you are delaying tasks, and opens up \nvarious interventions points for implementing your coping skills.\n\nThe aforementioned strategies are designed to bring you the precipice of your desired \naction plan. Ultimately, you will have to take that first step that represents actually doing \nwhat you set out to do. Each of the previous steps is intended to help prime you for the \ntask and to take proverbial baby steps toward follow-through rather than automatically \nfalling into the overlearned pattern of procrastination.\n\nAn important point to remember is that you still may not be \u201cin the mood\u201d to per-\nform the task or action. In fact, remember that you may overestimate how little energy, \nfocus, etc. is actually required to start a task. The final push to start a task or action is \nsimilar to legislative \u201cswing votes\u201d\u2014it need not be a unanimous decision; you simply \nneed to get to a 51\u201349 result to take the first step of behavioral engagement.

Rostain, Routledge\n\n\fOnce you get engaged in the task, by definition, you are no longer procrastinating \nand the likelihood of persistence increases exponentially. This good start does not mean \nthat you are immune to interruptions, distractions, or frustrations, but it is an important \nstep to move from the anticipations of a task to engaging in the reality of the task.\n\nPutting the Plan into Motion 39\n\nImplementation Plans\n\nAlthough getting started is a necessary step, part of the reality of dealing with procras-\ntination  is  that  you  will  be  facing  various  distractions  and  lower-priority  tasks  that \nare easier, more enjoyable, or that simply arise as convenient excuses for escape once \nyour initial gusto wears off a bit. It is useful to have implementation plans to support \nfollow-through.\n\nDrawn  from  research  on  children  with ADHD  (Gawrilow,  2011),  implementation \nintention plans are designed to externalize executive functioning by anticipating threats \nto your objectives and developing plans for managing those threats. You can think of \nthese strategies as a kind of malware for risks to your time management plans.\n\nFor example, a college student who plans to read an assigned textbook for 30 minutes \nwill likely face many distractions. Even if he reads in the library, he may see a friend walk \nby, receive a text message, or have a random thought about something he needs to do \nlater. Each of these innocuous distractions runs the risk of knocking him off track.\n\nImplementation plans involve developing contingency plans for these events. If-then \nplans are used to develop a strategy for getting started, such as \u201cIf I go to the library, \nthen I will read for at least 30 minutes,\u201d or for countering a specific distraction, such as \n\u201cIf I see a friend, then I will tell him I have to finish reading but will see him later,\u201d \u201cIf I \nreceive a text, then I will put my phone away and check it when I\u2019m done reading,\u201d and \n\u201cIf I think of something else I must do, then I will write a quick reminder to myself and \nthen keep reading.\u201d Instead of trying to maintain motivation by repeatedly focusing on \nan overall goal, implementation plans target specific risks to the current plan (which is \npart of a larger objective), which is consistent with the tactic of \u201centering the room with \na plan.\u201d Considering how easily adults with ADHD can be distracted, we have empha-\nsized developing these if-then plans to handle various task-interfering distractions, as \nwell as to handle transitions between tasks, returning from breaks, etc.\n\nThere is no guarantee that you will never be distracted or succumb to distraction. \nInstead,  the  combination  of  getting  engaged  in  the  task,  thinking  through  potential \ndistractions,  and  developing  your  adaptive  responses  (including  preventative  mea-\nsures, such as turning off your phone) work together to increase the likelihood of better \n follow-through on your plans than you have had in the past.

For example, a college student plans to research and write a 10-page essay \non a day when he does not have any classes. He plans to start writing at 10 a.m. and to \n\n\f40 Putting the Plan into Motion\n\nkeep writing for however many hours it takes him. It is important to remember that we \ndo not spend that much time on tasks we enjoy, much less a task as difficult as working \non a whole research paper, start to finish.\n\nWhat happens instead is that the student keeps putting off the task because his view \nof the time involved (e.g., several hours, \u201call day\u201d) or the task (e.g., the \u201cwhole\u201d paper, 10 \npages) is too overwhelming. The student \u201cchases the task\u201d all day, putting it off an hour at \na time\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll get coffee and then I\u2019ll get started\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll watch Sports Center and then I\u2019ll be \n\u2018in the mood\u2019 to write,\u201d etc. The student ends up frustrated that he has wasted away a full \nday and is still facing the fact he must write the entire paper with even less time in which \nto do so.\n\nInstead, we ask the student, \u201cWhat is the minimal amount of time you could work \non the paper even if it ends up being as difficult and uncomfortable (e.g., distracted, \ncannot organize thoughts) as you anticipate it might be?\u201d Usually, the answer is some-\nwhere around 10 minutes, hence our nickname for the intervention. The behavioral \ntask is to work on the task for a full and \u201chonest\u201d 10 minutes (600 seconds). The specific \nstep of engagement for the student is defined, such as \u201csit in front of the computer with \nthe essay file open and attempt to write down some thoughts without editing them.\u201d \nImplementation  plans  for  handling  possible  task-interfering  distractions  can  also  be \noutlined.\n\nAfter  spending  those  10  minutes  on  task,  the  student  reassesses  the  status.  If  the \ntask is, in fact, overwhelming or the student cannot focus on it, then it is acceptable to \nstop working on it, guilt-free. The student did not procrastinate but rather made an \n\u201cinformed decision\u201d based on his on-task attempt. Most often, however, after 10 min-\nutes, the student will have overcome the initial aversion to the task and will be able to \nmake some headway on it. The student probably will not finish the entire paper but will \nlikely have a productive writing session, and will be much more satisfied than had no \nwork been done.\n\nBe Aware of Your Escape Behaviors\n\nDespite  the  aforementioned  coping  strategies,  including  the  use  of  implementation \nstrategies, it is important to recognize to what distractions you are vulnerable when \nyou  are  in  the  throes  of  procrastination.

It is important to \nunderstand your procrastination \u201cscript\u201d and to disentangle the individual elements that \nput you at risk for this habit in order to start to rewrite this script. We have covered many \nbehavioral aspects of dealing with procrastination. Another essential element of overcom-\ning procrastination is managing your thoughts about the tasks you set out to perform.\n\nProcrastination Thoughts\n\nA significant component of the procrastination script is your in-the-moment attitude \nabout a task. More specifically, we are referring to the reflexive or automatic thoughts \nand reactions you have when you face a priority task (or any other sort of task you want \nto  do). When  constructing  your  Daily  To-Do  List,  each  task  you  put  on  this  list  was \ndefined in behavioral terms, seemed doable, and was a priority. You probably felt more \nenthusiastic at the prospect of taking action and about your ability to do so.\n\nWhen actually coming face-to-face with the task, however, you suddenly find your \noutlook has changed. You start to think that \u201cI\u2019m not up to this right now\u201d and \u201cThere \nare so many other nagging tasks I can get done right now; it will be good for me to \ndo them instead of this other task.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "258ada09-6a24-4eb9-951b-facf2819f3c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "258ada09-6a24-4eb9-951b-facf2819f3c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "8481bcf5-e368-46f5-a063-23d11cbe620c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cef277b484f38b84a01b76b9d3709af9b9485444380c2bdc23e8e36a2df8392b"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f02733b-6b57-4213-a1ea-169291dedb83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2bfaaf8b4a4006ee494efb4d69314840301196ce386c8ab1a4fc221b2a69b09"}}, "hash": "8e13918aaf15bb3aec10ade458a856588ed0871c8b958bfec99d60058b2d96db", "text": "I will do it tomorrow and it will be better because \nthese other things will be out of the way and I\u2019ll be able to focus just on this task. This \nis good!\u201d\n\nAll of a sudden, you are off doing something else, perhaps even recognizing that you \nare procrastinating as you do it. Later, as you realize that you did not keep to your plan and \nmisappropriated valuable time, you start to get down on yourself, thinking \u201cI had plenty \nof time to get this done today. How did I do this, again? I don\u2019t know when I will have time \nto work on it in the next few days and I\u2019m running out of time to get it done. This is bad!\u201d\nThe examples used above are not statements you or others make aloud but rather \ndescriptions  of  your  flow  of  thoughts  or  self-talk  in  the  moment.  These \u201cautomatic \nthoughts\u201d  about  your  priority  tasks  occur  just  out  of  your  conscious  awareness. You \nmight not even be aware of how quickly and persuasively they influence your emotions \n\n\fPutting the Plan into Motion 43\n\nand actions. The thoughts seemed plausible as they bounce around in your head, but \nthey are ultimately self-defeating.\n\nThese sorts of automatic thoughts and how they are handled represent the \u201ccogni-\ntive\u201d component of cognitive behavioral therapy. ADHD is not caused by negative or \ndistorted thinking, but, as you can see in the example above, it does not make living \nwith ADHD any easier. People without ADHD have similar thoughts when they delay \na task but are able to correct their reactions to ensure timely enough follow-through. \nAdults with ADHD, in contrast, end up repeatedly falling into the same procrastination \ncycle despite facing penalties for doing so. Thus, catching and changing these automatic \nthoughts is an important coping tool to learn.\n\nThe first step in dealing with negative automatic thoughts about a task or plan is to \ncatch them by asking, \u201cWhat am I thinking right now?\u201d These thoughts often do not occur \nin the form of grammatically correct sentences, but may be expressed in brief phrases \n(e.g., \u201cOh no,\u201d \u201cI hate this stuff,\u201d a string of expletives, etc.). In fact, sometimes procrasti-\nnation starts with an accurate statement (e.g., \u201cThe gym is crowded after work.\u201d), but that \ncan kick off a string of assumptions that result in procrastination (e.g., \u201cI won\u2019t be able to \nfind any open machines. It will either take me 3 hours to finish my workout or I won\u2019t be \nable to do my full workout. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m not up to dealing with crowds tonight. There \nis no use in going to the gym.\u201d). The subsequent evening spent watching lousy television \nshows while eating way too many cheese puffs leads to self-critical thoughts and frustra-\ntion with the missed workout (e.g., \u201cI could have gone to the gym. I would have been \ndone by now. Now I have to find time to make up this workout.\u201d).\n\nAt the outset, it is vital to be aware of how your thoughts make you prone to pro-\ncrastinate. Automatic thoughts are often distorted and impact your feelings about tasks. \nHence, you start to psych yourself out of doing something without having a chance to \nget started on it, which increases the likelihood of resorting to avoiding the task through \nan escape behavior.\n\nIn Chapter 7, we will discuss in greater detail some of the distorted thoughts and strat-\negies for modifying them, particularly with regard to the emotions they trigger, including \npure and simple discomfort about a task (i.e., \u201cUgh\u201d). When dealing with  procrastination, \nhowever, the most common distortion we encounter is magnification/minimization. That \nis,  you  pull  out  and  embellish  all  the  negative  elements  about  performing  a  task  and \nyou overlook or play down the positive elements and your ability to handle the task in \nquestion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f02733b-6b57-4213-a1ea-169291dedb83": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f02733b-6b57-4213-a1ea-169291dedb83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "258ada09-6a24-4eb9-951b-facf2819f3c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e13918aaf15bb3aec10ade458a856588ed0871c8b958bfec99d60058b2d96db"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e465f73-795e-431d-9cd9-64c1ed9af893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6828b78001dd6e32546cbf3934cf7133e3d50634e39b307085fbc5a65228f8f3"}}, "hash": "b2bfaaf8b4a4006ee494efb4d69314840301196ce386c8ab1a4fc221b2a69b09", "text": "For  example,  let\u2019s  say  you  reserve  time  on  Saturday  to  work  on  a  project  for  your \njob. You define the task in specific, behavioral terms, and at the time, the plan seems \ndoable. As the \u201cappointment time\u201d reserved for the task draws near, you start to magnify \nhow difficult the task will be, that you are \u201cnot up to it,\u201d and you envision spending the \nrest of your Saturday futilely struggling with the project, not making any progress and \ntherefore wasting precious weekend time. At the same time, you minimize the fact that \nyou only planned to work on it for 1 hour, you forget that you almost always work well \nonce you start, and dismiss the likelihood that you will feel better keeping to your plan. \nAfterwards, you are frustrated that you did not work on the task, and now have to carve \nout time during your busy week to work on it.\n\nTable 5.2 shows some of the common justifications for procrastination you will face. \n\nCan you come up with other thoughts that make you vulnerable to procrastination?\n\n\f44 Putting the Plan into Motion\n\nTable 5.2.  What Are Your Procrastination Rationalizations?\n\nWhat are the thoughts, excuses, justifications, etc. you commonly have that make it seem acceptable \nto avoid a task?\n\n1.  \u201cI\u2019ll do this first and then I\u2019ll be \u2018in the mood\u2019 to get to work on X.\u201d\n2.  \u201cI really cannot get started on X until I take care of this other thing.\u201d\n3.  \u201cI\u2019ll relax the rest of today and then I\u2019ll start fresh tomorrow and work on X.\u201d\n4.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like doing X now.\u201d\n5.  \u201cI need to be in the mood to do X.\u201d\n6.  \u201cI have plenty of time. It is ok if I do not do X now.\u201d\n7.  \u201cThere is a different task I can get done instead of X. I\u2019ll still be productive.\u201d\n\nThe next two sections focus in more detail on the cognitive and emotional anticipa-\n\ntion of the task that affects follow-through and ways to modify them.\n\nChange the Negative-to-Positive Anticipation Ratio\n\nAs was indicated above, it is common for there to be a one-sided ratio of task predic-\ntions,  such  that  the  negatives  about  a  plan  outnumber  and  outweigh  the  positives  of \ndoing it. There are some essential tasks, such as chores, errands, or other \u201chave-to\u201d tasks \nthat will never be viewed as recreational, although it does not mean that they are neces-\nsarily completely unpleasant. In fact, some chores are used as escape behaviors for other \ntasks, such as a run to the store for milk and bread to avoid dealing with income tax \npreparation.\n\nAn initial reframe is that you do not have to view a task as fun, but rather that it is \ndoable and time limited. Identifying the distorted view of the task and formulating more \nadaptive outlooks is an essential step. Previously mentioned strategies of defining the \ntask in behavioral terms and targeting the smallest step that will get you engaged will \nhelp to get you out of your head and focused on a realistic view of the action steps. You \nneed not \u201cbe in the mood\u201d for the task. You only need \u201cenough\u201d energy and commitment \nto get engaged in doing it.\n\nIn addition to changing the negative side of the negative-to-positive ratio, it is helpful \nto regenerate your commitment to your plan to build up the positive side of the ratio. \nYou likely underestimate the positive feelings associated with getting things done and \ngetting commitments off of your Daily To-Do List. It is a satisfying feeling to get rid of \ntasks on your lists and to not have to think about them anymore. Moreover, getting these \nthings done helps create a momentum that can carry over to other tasks\u2014an object in \nmotion tends to stay in motion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e465f73-795e-431d-9cd9-64c1ed9af893": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e465f73-795e-431d-9cd9-64c1ed9af893", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f02733b-6b57-4213-a1ea-169291dedb83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2bfaaf8b4a4006ee494efb4d69314840301196ce386c8ab1a4fc221b2a69b09"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fae159e-3382-4ce6-8e14-cf4d331f0cc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ded6f82def3843c8fce0b1012eb91facf6c7d683895eab7f57ad140ea68c84dd"}}, "hash": "6828b78001dd6e32546cbf3934cf7133e3d50634e39b307085fbc5a65228f8f3", "text": "Answering the following questions also helps you to think differently about a task: \nHow will this task be of benefit to you?

Can you view the urge to \nprocrastinate as a personal challenge (e.g., \u201cI can get started on this just to prove to \nmyself I can.\u201d)?\n\n\fPutting the Plan into Motion 45\n\nIt is okay to be a bit of a cheerleader for yourself in order to build momentum for the \ntask. In executive function terms, motivation is generating an emotion about a task in \nthe absence of an immediate consequence that helps get engaged. Even saying out loud \nto yourself the first step you will take is a way to get out of your head and get active. \nInspirational quotes or movie lines or other meaningful sayings can stir up positive feel-\nings and help you to refocus on implementing your action plan. It is often helpful to \nmake a verbal commitment to someone else to increase your accountability for a task. \nThese steps help to recalibrate your attitude about and anticipation of the task and to \nincrease its salience in the moment to increase the likelihood that you get engaged in it. \nRemember, you only need enough \u201cswing votes.\u201d\n\nIdentify and Accept Discomfort\n\nYou  will  invariably  face  jobs  that  are  associated  with  uncomfortable  feelings,  ranging \nfrom relatively minor annoyance (e.g., taking out the garbage in the rain) to more per-\nsistent  and  recurring  feelings  of  stress  and  discomfort  (e.g.,  dissertation,  organizing \nincome taxes) that activate your procrastination script. Even a minimal degree of stress \nor inconvenience (what we have come to describe as the feeling of \u201cUgh\u201d) can be potent \nenough to make you delay action.\n\nThink about some of the mundane examples of procrastination, such as watching \na  boring  television  show  because  the  remote  control  is  out  of  reach  (e.g., \u201cIt\u2019s ALL \nTHE WAY over there.\u201d) or exercise (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m TOO TIRED to change into my workout \nclothes.\u201d). The use of capital letters is meant to illustrate the tone of voice of your self-\ntalk, which serves to exaggerate and convince you of the difficulty of what you want to \ndo. You are capable to perform the action, but your thoughts and feelings (including \nfeeling tired or \u201clow energy\u201d) makes you conclude that you are not at your best and \ntherefore cannot and will not follow through (for seemingly justifiable reasons).\n\nYou might think, \u201cI have to be in the mood to do some things.\u201d But, how often are any \nof us in the mood to do many of the tasks on which we end up procrastinating? The very \nfact that we have to plan them indicates that these tasks require some targeted planning \nand effort. When facing emotional discomfort, ADHD adults are particularly at risk for \nbolting to pleasant, easy, and yet often unsatisfying activities, such as eating junk food, \nwatching television, social networking, surfing the Internet, etc.\n\nIn fact, sometimes you may escape from stressful tasks by performing other, lower-\npriority errands or chores. Thus, you rationalize violating your high-priority project plan \nin order to run out to fill your car with gas. This strategy can be seen as a form of \u201cplea \nbargaining\u201d\u2014\u201cI will do something productive in order to justify not doing the higher \npriority but less appealing task.\u201d Moreover, these errands are often more discrete and time \nlimited than the task you are putting off (i.e., \u201cIf I start mowing the lawn now, I will be \ndone in 1 hour. I don\u2019t know how long taxes will take me.\u201d), which is often their appeal\u2014\neven though they are low priority, you are more confident you will get them done.\n\nYou need not be \u201cin the mood\u201d for a task in order to perform it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fae159e-3382-4ce6-8e14-cf4d331f0cc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fae159e-3382-4ce6-8e14-cf4d331f0cc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a93ec1b5-aad8-4a6a-a701-0d680be70c04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd44c0af29636331b2299044550cb10b75a73cd22487ca536cf286aafaf537c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e465f73-795e-431d-9cd9-64c1ed9af893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6828b78001dd6e32546cbf3934cf7133e3d50634e39b307085fbc5a65228f8f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d9dddf3-c424-41c8-8af4-080b23ba1acf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c44f3cb315d1811a9ddae81435b8689662f7c1a8a1bd1cd03a0be01c9d614155"}}, "hash": "ded6f82def3843c8fce0b1012eb91facf6c7d683895eab7f57ad140ea68c84dd", "text": "A useful reframe \nis the reminder that you have \u201cenough\u201d energy to get started and recall that once you \nget  started  on  the  first  step,  you  usually  feel  better  and  more  engaged.

Rather than \n\n\f46 Putting the Plan into Motion\n\nsetting up the unrealistic expectation that you must be stress-free and 100% energized \nbefore you can do tasks, the notion of acceptance of discomfort is a useful mindset to \nadopt and practice.\n\nAcceptance of discomfort normalizes the fact that most tasks, even those that you \nvalue, such as exercise, require a degree of inconvenience and effort to perform (Hayes, \n2005).  This  is  the  reason  that  the  motivational  deficits  associated  with ADHD  are  so \nimpairing. Rather than setting minimal discomfort as a prerequisite for action (and an \nunrealistic  one,  at  that),  you  remember  that  other  people  experience  some  degree  of \ndiscomfort when they face the tasks with which you struggle.\n\nIt is important to notice and acknowledge your feelings, but nevertheless accept that \nthe feelings are manageable (even when uncomfortable) and that they do not dictate \nyour actions. You can feel tired but still perform the steps to prepare to go to the gym; \nor you can be somewhat distracted and on edge but still go through the steps involved \nin working on a school project for a minimal amount of time. You can use \u201cscaling\u201d to \nmaintain perspective on your discomfort (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m tired but I\u2019m not falling asleep on \nmy feet,\u201d or \u201cThe monthly reports always stress me out but most people probably face \nthings worse than this that they do not like to do.\u201d).\n\nThe  notion  of  adopting  a  nonjudgmental,  mindful  awareness  and  acceptance  of \nyour physical and emotional sensations is a useful coping skill for managing ADHD \n(Zylowska, 2012). Mindful awareness offers a degree of impulse control insofar as you \ncan notice and tolerate discomfort without being compelled to immediately escape the \nfeeling. In effect, you notice your emotional impulses without trying to change them. \nWith practice, you will be better able to recognize that feelings in these situations are \ndistinct from your actions and that you do not have to make the feelings go away as a \nprecondition for follow through on tasks. Moreover, you will increase your ability to \nstay committed to the task at hand rather than automatically engaging in escape.\n\nGetting  started  is  simultaneously  a  small  and  a  huge  step  in  overcoming  procras-\ntination. The gap between not doing and doing a task is often small but may appear \nlarge based on negative cognitive and emotional reactions to the task and the tempting \nescapes that are all around. Getting engaged in a task greatly increases the likelihood of \nfurther follow-through. However, once started, maintaining effort on a task through to \ncompletion requires the endurance of coping efforts, which is the focus of the next few \nchapters.\n\n\fTake Away 5.4.
