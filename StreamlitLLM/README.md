# Financial Statetments with Indicator

I am making finance analysis in Python to handle big data. In this project, I used mainly pandas,numpy, yfinance,openai,langchain libraries. For this purpose, beginner investors will understand Financial statements and they will ask a question about indicator meanings. Enjoy learning 🧭.

## What I did do that Project? 🔎

IGenerally, I created statistical values in that here. I used Yahoo Finance datasets. Furthermore, many people don't know financial literacy. I used the LangCahin bridge for OpenAI. So, people will ask a question about unclear financial glossary. You can find my working codes in [Worksheet.ipynb](https://github.com/Ybatuhan-EcoBooster/StreamlitLLM/blob/main/WorkFolder/WorkSheet.ipynb) file.

## Streamlit Library 💻
**Streamlit:** : I made some part of my project on Streamlit. It provided many tools for achieving my project's visualization.

## 📌 Sources 
- [Data Sets](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- [Streamlit Visualization](https://docs.streamlit.io/)

## Conclusion 👨🏻‍💻

When I started Financial analysis, I discovered Python and other tools. I developed myself with open sources without any course. In this journey, I decided to improve myself in data analysis with Finance. I hope you will learn more finance and coding skills in my project.
