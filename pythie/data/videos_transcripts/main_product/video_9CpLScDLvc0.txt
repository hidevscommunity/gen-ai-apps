[Music] this video is sponsored by Google so they wanted me to talk about the photography features of the Google pixel 7. specifically the Magic Eraser tool and the photo on blur tool and I thought wait a minute this will be perfect because I've used both of those tools extensively on my trip last year to Korea I just use them for a lot of the photos I took there so I thought the best way to do this video is just to show you how I use those things on that trip okay so let's start off with the Magic Eraser because this feature is one of the main reasons why I even brought this phone to Korea in the first place so it's a tool that uses machine learning to select unwanted or distracting elements in your photo and then removes them so when I was on the trip I would take a bunch of photos and then I'd be looking at them in the photos app just kind of looking at the shots I'd just taken and oftentimes I would find photos whether it was a person or a group of people or sometimes objects that just kind of took away from the shot and I'll just want that stuff gone so if you go to edit and then tools you can see the Magic Eraser feature and if you tap it it'll examine or kind of process your photo and then I'll make some suggestions by highlighting certain elements that you might want removed from the photos now sometimes the suggested edit Nails it right and the photo looks awesome right after it but sometimes it's overly aggressive sometimes it's not aggressive enough and it leaves objects or people behind that it thought you wanted in the photo but you can always adjust it manually you can go in you can Circle things or brush over them to remove it the manual tweaking doesn't have to be perfect like as long as it's roughly over the object the tool can use AI to fill in the area it can sometimes leave some visual imperfections but you're not pixel peeping your vacation photos right these are from memories and they're just better memories with cleaned up photos but overall I find this magic eraser tool to be really useful because oftentimes you just cannot take shots of stuff out there without a bunch of people in the scene just kind of photo bombing your shots it's not intentional right it's just the way that popular places are there's a lot of people and with this tool you can clean up a lot of photos with just a couple of TAPS right on your phone you don't need any kind of third-party downloads and that's the thing right you can do a lot of this stuff using like photoshop on a computer or just other apps you get on your phone but to have it baked into your phone on the stock Google photos app it's so convenient it's not perfect like sometimes it can leave behind some artifacts and if you magic erased the same spot over and over again it can start to look a little weird but more often than not you'll be able to use it to clean up images and it's non-destructive in the sense that if you're making the edits you can always undo it and even when you save that finalized edit it saves it as a new file it doesn't overwrite the original there's also a camouflage app in there so you can use to change the colors of specific objects they don't stand out as much it's more of a stylistic tool but again it's built right into the Google photos app okay the other feature that's really awesome is the photo on blur tool so this takes a blurry image and then it tries to reconstruct it using AI to make it a little bit sharper so so some of the photos I took in Korea came out a little soft either my kids were running around or I wasn't able to hold the camera perfectly still but they just weren't as sharp as I was hoping them to be but with this tool you can salvage some of them so if you want to sharpen up a blurry shot you go to edit and then tools and then there's an unblur tool and when you tap it it takes a couple seconds to analyze the shot and then it applies that machine learned unbluring so it applies it at full strength to start but you can dial it down depending on how much unbluring you want I do find that if you let it go to full blast it starts to look a little artificial depending on the shot so usually I have it turned down to like 60 to 70 at most now sometimes the unblurred shots come out awesome like this one this is one of my favorite picks from the trip and was salvaged from photo and blur but sometimes like this image here there's no hope the original image was just so cooked that there's no way you can save it but again these tools are baked right into the phone I think that's the best feature right you're already on your phone in the Google photos app looking at photos anyway and if you see something that just looks a little bit out of place and you want some tweaking the tools are right there the photo on blur or the Magic Eraser tool or some of us both at the same time if you need them they're very powerful tools but these camera features are also available on any other Google pixel phone you can use that link above to go directly to the Google photos app and play around with it there also all this stuff can be done with other people's photos like if you have family or friends that are on different phones they can send you their photos you can do the tweaks on your device and then send them back I did that a lot when I was in Korea okay there you have it if you want more information about any of the stuff I've talked about or the phone itself it'll be linked Down Below in the description okay thanks for watching foreign
