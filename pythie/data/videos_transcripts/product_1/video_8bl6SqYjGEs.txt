so i've been using the s22 ultra for nearly a month now and i've never used a note or a phone with a pen before but actually i've started using the s pen a lot in my daily tasks so this is definitely a super unique phone and today i'll be giving you guys a full review on it including the cameras the screen the battery life and also the controversial game optimizing service issue and although it's a super impressive phone overall i did notice some unexpected flaws in my day-to-day use okay so probably the most unique thing about this phone is that it's got a pen built inside of it now i wasn't really sure about it at first because the s pen is quite small and it's also very flat but i would say it feels very comfortable to hold and i can write as well with it as i do with a normal pen and paper the s pen actually has near perfect tracking in the default samsung notes app however in third-party note-taking apps like onenote for example i've noticed that the tracking isn't nearly as good but overall the s-pen is still super responsive it feels great to write with it and if you do things that benefit from hand-drawn diagrams or just other kinds of annotations then i definitely think having a pen could be super helpful now i didn't really do lots of writing with the s pen but there were still many other features that i found to be very useful there's the screen off memo which is really cool because it lets you write on the screen just by pulling out the s-pen the screen doesn't need to be turned on and this is probably one of my favorite s-pen features because the black background and also the neon colors just look really cool and whenever i have something really important that i want to make sure that i remember i would just write it down here and then i can actually also pin this to my always on display and this way whenever i pick up my phone i'll be reminded of it which is really nice alright so on other samsung phones you could draw on screenshots photos and videos now when i use my s21 and also testing out the s22 plus i've never done it before but on this phone since i can actually write precisely with the s pen i've actually started to write little annotations and also circle things on my screenshots so that when i send it over to my friends it makes more sense on its own and i no longer have to explain what it is or where to look at but beyond writing and drawing you can actually also use the s pen to do air actions and with those i can take photos or videos just by pressing down on the s pens button so whenever i want to take stuff like group photos i can very easily use the back main camera or even the ultrawide to get a better looking shot and there are also some more fun features like writing on the samsung calendar and also coloring and yes the pen does make a sound but you can turn it off so yeah i never really thought i would use a pen with my phone but now that i have it it's actually quite useful in many ways okay so on paper the s18 ultra has one of the best screens out there and it is fantastic in many ways it's an ltpo panel with an adaptive 120hz refresh rate it's also a 2k plus screen with 500 pixels per inch which is really high it also has a wider than usual color gamut so the colors really pop on this phone and everything looks super sharp as well watching videos is very nice on this phone but even just scrolling around like on instagram or reddit the wider color gamut does make all the colors seem a bit more saturated and i think this is noticeable even against the iphone 13 pro which already has a pretty good color gamut also the s22 ultra screen can go very bright to a peak of 1750 knits and this is much brighter than the iphone and also the regular s22 maximum brightness on this phone is probably way overkill for indoor use but for outdoor use and also for watching hdr videos this extra brightness is really nice so this screen and also combined with the nice sounding speakers makes the s22 ultra especially good for viewing content online and also watching videos but for me the one big downside of the screen is that it has a really steep curve on the edges so especially when looking at bright content the curved part of the screen looks dimmer than the rest and i think this is pretty distracting imagine if the top and bottom of this video were darkened that's kind of what everything looks like on this phone and also the curve catches light so at some angles there are just these two streaks of light that cut through the screen overall these issues aren't too too bad but since the curved screen really doesn't add any functionality or look particularly good i would much rather have just a regular flat screen on the s22 ultra okay and speaking of the design so this phone is really well put together it's covered in gorilla glass victis plus the back is matte and the texture does feel pretty good but it does catch a bit of fingerprints there's some on there right now i'm not sure if you can see it on camera or not it has the usual ip68 water and dust resistance but i do have some issues with the build the corners are very sharp so when combined with the pretty hefty weight of this phone holding this with one hand does get uncomfortable pretty quickly because the corners do dig into my palm but the sides of this phone are actually rounded so if you're gonna mostly use a phone with two hands and just hold it by the side like this then it's pretty comfortable and i don't think the sharp corners are a huge issue because they can be easily covered up with a phone case and now i want to tell you guys about caystify the sponsor of this portion of the video so all of case defy's cases come in 100 compostable packaging their impact cases are made with 65 recycled and plant-based materials and their crush impact cases are made from upcycled phone cases case defy is actually able to reduce their carbon footprint by 20 also also case-to-fight cases have defensify antimicrobial coating which eliminates 99 of bacteria by preventing the growth of microbes and preventing bacteria from sticking to the surface in the first place now case the fi has many cool designs for their phone cases so you can pick your favorite color or print for your case to match with your phone and style you can even customize a case with your own monogram or name and their cases also support wireless charging now case device impact and crush impact cases are super sleek and slim even slimmer than a 10 cent coin but they are also engineered with a two layer construction of upgraded chi tech 2.0 material so they are 6.6 feet drop test approved let's test this out so now i'm going to purposely drop my new s22 ultra [Music] you can see my phone and the case are both completely fine case device cases can definitely be a great gift for your friends family or even for yourself you can go to caystify.com created by ella today to get 15 off so the s22 ultra has a 108 megapixel main camera a three times in a second 10 times optical zoom telephoto and also a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera so i took lots of photos and videos with this phone and when taking photos with the main camera you can actually choose between 108 megapixel mode or just the regular 12 megapixel mode and the 108 mode does make a big difference it gives a lot more detail than the default mode the difference isn't super noticeable if we don't zoom in on the phone but with the 108 mode you can definitely crop in way more in post with the image still looking sharp so there's more flexibility there however do note that the files are nearly five times larger and the 108 megapixel photo is definitely the most detailed photo taken by a phone i've ever seen here's a side by side with a photo taken with the iphone 13 pro you can just see more detail in the 108 image especially when we punch in but for me the most interesting camera on this phone is the 10 times optical zoom it lets me see really far way beyond what my eyes can see and of course this could definitely be useful for reading far away signs and actually the 10 times telephoto quality looks pretty good it doesn't have the same quality of the main camera but it certainly looks a lot better than just cropping in on a regular three times telephoto lens now the photos from the three times telephoto lens on this phone do look pretty good too on its own but i think it's the weakest link in this camera system side by side with the iphone's three times telephoto camera we can see that the text here just isn't as sharp all right and the ultra white photos on this phone are pretty decent as well there's nothing too special going on here and same with the front selfie camera although i did notice that compared to the iphone the samsung does smooth out my skin more now software wise the samsung's camera app is packed with some pretty fun features there's the pro photo mode which lets you adjust things like the iso focus and also the white balance precisely there's also a single take where you take a video of something for up to 15 seconds and then from that video the phone will automatically make a bunch of photos and videos like these with filters and even this fake 24 hour time lapse video and i actually think it looks quite realistic so yeah overall the s92 ultra has a really good camera system it outperforms other androids and also the latest iphone in many aspects and it has some really fun features too but against the iphone the only area where it's far behind is raw photos the raw photo on the samsung is just a single frame and not a smart composition of several frames like apple pro raw so the samsung raw photo is just a really noisy image with poor dynamic range so not very useful the s22 ultra's video quality is very good too with pretty insane stabilization the video looks detailed perhaps a bit over sharpened but it also has very good dynamic range but the hdr capability is a bit of a letdown it's not on by default and you have to go into the camera settings and then advanced recording options and then toggle on recording videos in hdr 10 plus and the quality of hdr videos is inconsistent under certain conditions there are lots of artifacts and i also noticed that when recording a light bulb specifically it seems to think that it's the sun so it paints it this orange color but when it comes to the performance of this phone on paper it's pretty decent just like other snapdragon 8 gen 1 phones however samsung actually has this game optimizing service that slows down all the common games and apps to reduce the heat and also to save battery but this is at the cost of performance benchmarking apps like 3dmark the one that i've been using actually aren't limited in the same way so you may very well end up with much lower gaming performance than what the benchmark scores indicate this obviously is far from ideal but at least with the new software update you can turn the game optimizing service off it is a bit convoluted though you have to go into the game booster settings and then labs and then toggle this thing on in order to turn off the gos and without the gos the phone does get really hot under heavy load so hot that it's really not comfortable to hold it at all but regardless of the gos being on or off the phone is still very much limited by heat after around just five minutes of heavy gaming i'm not a big mobile gamer so i haven't really encountered any issues with the speed but if you play some more demanding games then this could definitely be an issue all right and now let's talk about the battery life of this phone so i tested the battery life over the course of a day and i kept the refresh rate on adaptive the screen brightness at about 75 it was connected to wi-fi the entire time and i did change the resolution to 2k plus which it actually doesn't default to so the battery life of this thing is actually quite good it went from 100 to about 5 in the span of 41 hours 34 of those hours were screened off but there was over seven hours of screen on time and of those there were nearly five hours of playing youtube videos and over one hour of running benchmarks so even with this insanely heavy use this phone can last a full day now in my more typical use case it lasts on average two days on a single charge but again i don't really use data or gps that often also the s22 ultra supports 45 watt fast charging which charges up the phone really fast when it's almost dead but do note that it doesn't come with a brick so you might have to buy a new brick to take full advantage of the 45 watt fast charging so overall this is surprisingly a very interesting phone for me the s pen is quite useful and the 10 times telephoto is really cool too but this is one of the most expensive phones on the market so i do wish that the processor performance can be better and also better raw photos and the hdr videos to be artifact free but yeah let me know what you think of the s92 ultra down below and if you did enjoy this video please give it a thumbs up if you want to see more videos like this
