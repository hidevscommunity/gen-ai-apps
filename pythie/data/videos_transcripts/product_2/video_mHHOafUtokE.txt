should you upgrade to the iPhone 14 pro no and here's why firstly Apple's version of the always on display is a confusing mess when you look at Android's implementation of the always on display you can see how it's much less intrusive than on the iPhone and it drains the battery far too much to be actually worth using it in terms of the battery the 14 pro Max actually has a smaller battery capacity than the 13 Pro Max even with the upgraded chip it consumes power like a hungry beast and probably won't get you through a whole day next up is the dynamic Island which is a very Innovative blend of software and Hardware but I don't have extendable thumbs so actually using the dynamic island is a bit of a pain moving on to cameras now Apple have made some improvements to the cameras but they really aren't that much better than the 13 models and what was Apple thinking when they put that useless two-time zoom on there surely you could just stand closer lastly with apple being forced to switch to USBC charging my recommendation is to just wait for that as we'll soon be able to charge all of our devices using the same cables lightning can just do one that's it for the big question
