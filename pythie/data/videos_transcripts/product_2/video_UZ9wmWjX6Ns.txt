we're not too far away from an upgraded iPhone 14 pro in the form of a 15 Pro but since having this since launch I recently covered the iPhone 14 pro Max and I thought about discussing the iPhone 14 pro with you since I've actually quite liked this phone as well and even though a lot of phones have launched since this device has come out it Still Remains one of my favorite on the market today and I'm explaining you my long-term honest review of the iPhone 14 pro so when it comes to the design in the build iPhone is starting to become kind of it kind of feels like it's an appliance to me you know it's Blends in with everyday life but it's a premium Appliance if you will it's a premium product and every time I pick it up I still get a sense of this thing just feels really beautiful to hold and while we do have a lot of other phones out there that are also coming with beautiful designs there's something about the flat edges just the Chris lines to this phone the even the dynamic Island although it is you know not my favorite it still has you know its own unique Flair to it so when I use this phone and I pick it up it actually still feels premium more premium than about 95 of the rest of the market the only thing feeling a little more premium I feel like is the 14 pro Max and maybe you could argue some Samsung phones are maybe slightly more premium and some elements but overall you know the size to weight ratio the heft with the stainless steel on here it just it just has a nice feel to it so long term since launching this phone I like how this one feels very similar to the 13 Pro and that it still retains that beautiful build that beautiful body but you can put it in a size that's more comfortable in the hand so this phone long term I absolutely love it now I will tell you that the dynamic island is something that I still kind of look at even though I've had this since it launched I still look at the dynamic Island quite a bit I also find that it's a little bit more prominent on the iPhone 14 pro like it's just more in your face because there's less screen area below that Dynamic Island in addition to that we do have camera bumps or that are kind of thick on this phone and I think they might get thicker on the next one maybe they'll get thinner because Apple's rumored to make the phone thicker we'll have to see the Deep Purple colorway is not quite the purple I thought it was going to be but it's still got a kind of a gray issue in certain lights like if I look at like it looks black right there and this lighting you know on certain angles it's just not purple purple so if you're a true purple fan you know the Deep Purple iPhone 14 pro is not the most purpley phone out there it's a deeper literally a deeper purple now the charging port down there is still a lightning Port so you know I still I literally earlier today day I was trying to stick a USBC plug in here I was like like this and it didn't go and I was like you know what that that is something they need to upgrade we need to go to USBC it would definitely be quite nice now another thing I want to talk about is the silent switch I know it's something very minimal but besides OnePlus phones I still kind of like using this even though this is such an old feature on the iPhone and it's just still quite nice now the iPhone 14 pro when it comes to its display quality is absolutely tremendous but there is a caveat now this phone has been incredibly bright it's the easiest phone I've ever seen Outdoors even the current Samsung phones hit 1750 this hits 2 000 nits of brightness so the brightness on this phone is actually superseding that of the you know Galaxy device so it's it's actually brighter now the calibration of this display is pretty similar to when you throw an Android phone into like a natural color mode with a little bit more punch so Apple has like a slight more saturation over a natural mode I would say like a Galaxy phone um so it's kind of got a nice mix between a natural feel and a saturated look so the iPhone 14 pro really giving you kind of The Best of Both Worlds and it actually should because there is no way to tweak this display now the 120 hertz panel experience on here the promotion is absolutely butter now the reason why is because when you combine the efficiency of iOS you combine the a16 processor in here and you combine the fact that apple is controlling everything around the board I have not seen a phone that still has outshined the iPhone and the level of Polish now you've seen in my recent speed test than when I open up applications just The Buttery smooth look when we go through things this is an area where Android phones could still improve while they are very fast and even in some cases way more snappier looking on that initial launch when it comes to swiping out with the gestures and stuff iPhone still has the smoothest most polished look so even though this can be boring to some people the iOS experience I say boring because it's not boring to everybody some people like using their air pods using their iPads and their iPhones and their Macs and it all just works together so for those people it's not boring but for those people who think it's boring at least we can say if we're iPhone users we can say that we enjoy you know this super smooth polished look but I will say I think I've tried the xiaomi 13 Pro I think the MIUI even though it's not everybody's favorite is actually quite polished as well in terms of the animations now the software itself is a little messy but you know that's the one I find to be quite close with the animation look and speed I'm also Google pixel is right up here with iPhone but Samsung needs to do some work and some other filmmakers as well well aren't quite as smooth with the animations but I find OnePlus phones to be even faster when launching applications but on the whole you really can't go wrong with this display incredibly bright great size it's like a 6.1 inch we have Night Shift dark mode and there's not a lot of phones here's another kicker about the 14 pro there's not a lot of phones at this price range or not this price which is a higher price phone for 6.1 there's a lot of phones at this size range that's like super premium like top of the line not a lot of them at this price range so you can get the Galaxy s23 plus which is pretty darn close but that phone is you know that's a bigger phone dude you got to go with the s23 which some people think is better than this phone not quite as you know powerful cpu-wise but definitely I think the 14 pro is kind of the king of this 6.1 inch size in terms of the most premium device at that size that you can get now talking about software Apple has given me a little bit of trouble over my several months of usage not too much but a little bit of trouble and that means that some applications have crashed on me here and there but overall we've seen pretty darn good performance you know on the day-to-day it's it's really it's not the worst we we could see worse performance on this but honestly I've just had a few app crashes some buggy software here and there it doesn't usually happen when I'm trying to show you stuff on camera but honestly it has hasn't been as smooth and refined as I've seen in Prior iOS versions and you know we hold iOS to a high standard because it usually is like a Flawless performer but this time around I have found several apps to have crashed so that was earlier on these days though in the latest versions of iOS 16.4 0.1 we even got a rapid security response lately the actual performance has improved it has gotten better I will say that so overall you know this this software still got so many years left of updates it's pretty darn good I just want to see apple do a little bit more with the split screen maybe give us something like that give us some more features on here I think it's getting a little bit stale we can't see we need to see a little bit more with iOS 17 which is right around the corner performance wise there's no way to tweak animations on here so you can go through these applications very fast but you're not going to be able to change the animation speed besides you know you can reduce motion and stuff like that but honestly do you really need to look how fast this phone is it's blazing fast even while the app's coming out you could actually bring it out before it comes out of that application fast faster than it can even open so it's just it's insane like how fast this phone is the Apple a17 not available for this phone should be even faster but a16 bionic with six gigs of RAM has been Stellar you know it really has even though it's mostly an a15 chip slightly better you know it definitely has been stellar and one of the things I really like about the 14 Pros is that when you're really running like games videos going between a lot of stuff it can handle all the heat that you bring to it and this phone rarely gets hot so definitely really good there I do think some of the Galaxy s23 models do a little bit better with heat management but it rarely gets hot I don't I don't find it getting too hot I mean if you're in the sunlight you got this one on the dash definitely might get a little too hot but really most of the time it's incredibly cool and very comfortable to hold even when you're running through more power heavy tasks that you would do on your smartphone so performance Rock Solid storage on the iPhone 14 pro is available with up to around one terabyte no more than that but that's pretty good now I got me the 256 gigs I've already used 157 gigabytes on this phone which is most of it so as we go on we're going to need more storage variants but the only thing I don't like about this phone is that the extra storage tiers really Jack the price up on this phone for I feel like no reason like it shouldn't be that much more for some more storage but you are going to pay several hundred dollars more when you go to say a 128 gig to a 512 or even a one terabyte you're looking at four or five hundred dollars more for that same smartphone so storage comes at a big premium on this phone but this nvme storage is incredibly fast Wicked just blazing quick so storage is pretty solid now so let's talk about the camera the camera you know here's the thing the only thing wow can't even tap a camera today the only thing I really noticed that kind of bugged me a little bit with this camera it didn't bug me because I understand how these cameras work but you know it's just a little bit more Pro well there's definitely more Pro if you come out of the macro mode for example look at like things are out of focus you're gonna have to leave it there my wife actually had this phone and she wanted to return to the 13 simply because she wanted to go ahead and have a better you know focusing um on the camera so basically with the 13s more of a standard iPhone camera everywhere you point it's best Focus as possible with this you kind of have a little bit of a further focusing distance on the 14 pro and so you gotta step back just bring the phone back just a little bit to nail that shot every time once you do it's your typical iPhone quality it's it's super good super smooth and one of the things I am super missing when I use the 14 pro is this Zoom they just need more zoom straight up on the iPhone 15x is not cutting it it's it's a solid amount but it's not cutting it like it doesn't go far enough you know I feel like for somebody who's really into photography and on video you can definitely hit up to 9x which is not super far either what I really love about this camera is 4K 60 4K 24 just all the modes in the video is phenomenal on the iPhone 14 pro long-term review of it I honestly I don't even crave I I literally do not crave a better camera you know I mean there's more zoom I would like but these things feel like like little jumps that really don't really enhance you know my life too much or maybe even your life depending on what you're doing with your smartphone but if you're really into zooming there are other options out there and if you wait for the 15 models and you really want zoom if you want it the zoom then that's going to be the main thing because the camera itself is pretty darn amazing another thing I feel like they could do a little bit better is you know sharp sharper photos on that Zoom so again we're talking about the zoom but just when you start getting past the their Optical this just gets really noisy on the iPhone 14 pro I mean this is not a great example but I start to see a lot more noise on photos where I zoom all the way in so I just want to see more zoom that's the main thing that I'm missing on here 8K would be nice if Apple wants to put 8K on an ultra iPhone that would be a really a luxurious Extra Touch but it's not really necessary the front facing camera is incredible on the iPhone 14 pro it's one of my favorite reasons to use these these models because these models do really represent the best of the best I feel like when it comes to nailing the skin tone when it comes to giving you that type of photo that type of video that you're looking for to just kind of match up you know with reality essentially like the rear camera the front camera they match up amazing And for those reasons long term I gotta say this camera probably on my high list as one of the main options I'm going to grab I'm gonna even grab it over my main camera for just everyday photography and videography went out and about something that's overlooked is how good the speakers are motion here in here and you don't gotta pay for an iPhone 14. that makes this a steal still so the iPhone 14 pro has incredible speakers when it comes to audio so if you want to listen to music whatever you want to do it's incredibly solid on here for the iPhone 14 pro so do keep in mind that if you do want to pick this up and you're looking for really good speaker audio it's great also Bluetooth connects fast and all that jazz it's all really good connectivity on here arguably competing very well now with Samsung when it comes to the reception strength and stuff like that now battery life 3200 milliamp hour battery in here 15 Wireless watt magsafe charging and this does have the ability to charge again via lightning not the fastest out there they can really go to town and proving that on this this phone for me is a day phone with medium to getting close to heavy use when I start heavy using this I'm not able to make the full day on this phone I do need to throw it on the charge at some point with the iPhone 14 pro Max I'm going into the second day still running but not quite on the iPhone 14 pro with my type of usage my type of usage is heavy camera High brightness I also do a lot of Internet research stuff like that business tasks things like that I'm really heavy on the phone and this one for me needs a charge before bed but the iPhone 14 pro Max can definitely outdo this one so the face ID you know on here is still nice we still like that Dynamic Island I haven't talked much about it in this video I talked about it earlier but I don't want to harp on about it because it's kind of just fades in the background we get calls we get we get certain things here and there that pop up there but it's just really it's kind of faded in the background it definitely reminds me though that I'm on the latest phone so that is something if you care about stuff like that but it really hasn't been life-changing feature for me long term I'm gonna wrap it up here with the iPhone 14 pro honestly we're getting super close to the 15 Pro and I wanted to give this one last cover before we start getting into iOS 17 before we compare this to the iPhone 15 Pro should you buy it now if you have that question I would say wait to the 15 Pro unless you need an absolute Flagship this minute but still I don't think anything has really knocked this phone off you know it's where it's at like I still think people will choose other devices that are cheaper that are giving them premium specs just to save some cash but in terms of being top of the line apple is still holding that area they're still holding that premium segment down pretty good with the iPhone 14 pro so it's still it's still playing at the in the big leagues right here even though it's not you know foldable devices not game changing you know it has super high brightness super amazing video great social media content creation tool you know very good software long support blazing fast CPU the probably the most premium feeling phone at this size range you can hold in your hand you know not a lot of things are touching this phone out there so definitely really good thumbs up if you enjoyed this video subscribe if you haven't already and I'll catch you all in the very next episode thank you very much for
