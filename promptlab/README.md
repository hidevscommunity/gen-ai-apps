# PromptLab 👩🏻‍🔬

https://promptlab.streamlit.app/

Welcome to the PromptLab! Here's your quick step-by-step guide to help you get started with the app.

## Getting Started

### 🔄 Connect
Start by uploading your own csv table or a provided demo dataset.

### 📊 Explore
After uploading the selected table, you should see a preview of your data. Ensure that you are working with the correct table before proceeding to create prompts and analyze the results.

## Using the App

To use the PromptLab, you will need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can get it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### 🛠️ Improve
If you have ideas but are uncertain about the wording of your prompts, PromptLab has you covered. Simply enter your idea, and click the "Improve" button. The app will provide you with an improved version of your prompt that adheres to prompt engineering best practices.

### 🤹‍♂️ Test
This is where you can experiment and fine-tune your prompts. You can input 1-3 prompts to run with your data, and each prompt comes with its own settings. You can adjust parameters such as temperature to control the creativity of the responses or compare results across different models. Additionally, you can specify the portion of your dataset you want to work with.

 Once you are satisfied with your prompts and settings, click the "OKaaaAAAaaAYYYy LETS GO 🎢" button. The app will work its magic, running all the prompts and returning the responses.

### 🔍 Analyze
Review the responses generated by the app and determine which prompt works best for your data. Pay attention to the responses' similarity score to identify areas where prompts may seem contradictory. This can help you refine your prompts and gain insights into potential model challenges.
