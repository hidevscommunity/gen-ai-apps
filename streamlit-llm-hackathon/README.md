# DocsBot
This project aims to develop an advanced conversational AI system capable of processing and generating responses across multiple documents. Leveraging Llama2, an innovative language model, this chatbot will enable users to engage in natural language conversations while seamlessly accessing information spread across various sources and documents. The chatbot will use generation techniques to provide users with accurate and context-aware responses, enhancing information retrieval and knowledge sharing in a dynamic and user-friendly manner.
