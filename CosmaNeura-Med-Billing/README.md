Accessibility is something that I aim to develop for the people who are going through a tough patch in life.
When my family first moved here, a lot of medical care processes are time consuming and inefficient.
First is the long wait time for system to update and pull information on a patient.
Second is the rate of mis-diagnosing difficult and critical health complications due to a mash of multiple health issues, present in medical history but not completely analyzed by doctors that my family and family friends have seen.
Third is the cost; If you make below $60-80K per annual per person in the bay, it becomes difficult to sustain any prolonged healthcare needs.
- When my mother had stage 3 breast cancer back when I was 15, it made me think deeply about how crucial it is for the healthcare patient physician support system to get an upgrade. Now that I am 24 and has access to all of the tools to assemble something to make a difference, I decided to do something that matters!
