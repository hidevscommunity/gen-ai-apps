I can't taste too much of the fruit to be honest. Breads: The breads are nice, but the stuffing is too little compares to the overall size of the bread, it's tasty tho. They offer an area to eat and drink after purchase, pretty nice.",85-c-bakery-cafe-las-vegas-2

They have pastries, coffee, ice cream and Gelato. They probably have more products but I was looking for some good ice cream. I settled on a small cup of coffee with sprinkles. It was a nice scoop. The ice cream was rich and tasty. I also sampled a friend's girl scout thin mint ice cream. It was a winner too. The store is bright and clean. Everything seems to be clearly marked to help the new clientele. Give the place a try.",churn-homemade-ice-cream-and-coffee-pittsburgh

9403,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fatty-daddys-scottsdale-5,1,9/9/2019,"The texture was good, but the taste was absolutely TERRIBLE!!! We tried four different flavors and all of them had a horrible metallic taste to them throughout every single bite. Ended up throwing them out- such a waste of money. Unless you enjoy the taste of licking a metal pan, I highly recommend saving your money and heading to an ice cream shop where they have food handling standards & customer service skills. The owner of the place is who served us; she handled the money with her bare hands & then scooped our ice cream without washing her hands or putting on gloves. MAJOR HEALTH CODE VIOLATION! If that's how the owner is handling the food she serves then I have zero confidence that she trained her staff to have proper food handling skills. Nothing worse than leaving a place feeling ripped off (and wondering what else those dirty hands touched before handling your food). Another review stated that the customer found pieces of plastic in their ice cream- definitely wish I had read the reviews before subjecting myself & my children to this place.",fatty-daddys-scottsdale-5

The donuts were hard and the store offer a lot of candies you can typically buy in any store but pretty much 3 times the price. But if you are truly having a sugar fit you can buy it here no complains. The way you can get lured into here is the colorful ambience and the way the store is design. Its almost the candy house of from Hansel and Gretel in the middle of the forest but this one is inside the grand canal shops. They have other nice props that are cute that are for sale at the store too. Oh yeah, they also have the nice Chanticleer that is for sale for 300 something, pretty nice!

I was able to get a birthday cake donut on my birthday it tasted exactly like birthday cake!!! I also noticed that they have franchise options I had no idea donut bar was a franchise? Maybe one of these will pop up in California close to me soon because their donuts are fantastic!!!! They also have a large selection of drip coffee. Heather just having decaf or regular there were five options that you could choose from even in flavored coffee,donut-bar-las-vegas

13749,https://www.yelp.com/biz/milk-bar-las-vegas-las-vegas-3,4,9/9/2018,This review is for 4.5 stars. Expensive all around but tasty and novel. Come here and just go fill out. Try the milkshakes the pie and the soft serve. Each will run you about $6-15 but well worth it. This will be the best version of whatever you order. We tried the crack pie and the cereal milk soft serve for $6.50 each and an additional $1.50 for the cereal crunch topping (necessary). The soft serves wee large enough for a nice after dinner dessert and they even give you samples of you ask before choosing the soft serve. Line can get log during peak but pretty fast service once ordered. The cereal milk is just so unique of an idea and deserves its infamy. Tastes as it sounds and if you let it melt drinks as it sounds. The crack pie is super buttery and just a very smooth and rich vanilla. Terrific flavors.,milk-bar-las-vegas-las-vegas-3

16579,https://www.yelp.com/biz/donut-bar-las-vegas,5,9/9/2017,"Good donuts, damn good donuts. What else is there to know? Ah... if you insist... So I guess this place is famous. I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop. Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display! Homer's donut? Matcha donut? Nutella donut? What!? Which should I try? The answer is ALL OF THEM! Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen. The french toast donut was my favorite. I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it. It comes with syrup on the side as well. My only regret is not buying two! It was that good. I loved Homer's donut as well. I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top? It was simple, but great. The strawberry split was SO good! My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut. I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut. Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts! Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead. It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling. They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out. I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line. Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas! PROTIP: Their menu changes DAILY! You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE! And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum. I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken. This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",donut-bar-las-vegas

17159,https://www.yelp.com/biz/donut-bar-las-vegas,2,9/9/2017,"This review is for the Creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut. Texture was great---crisp caramelized sugar glaze with a creamy center. However, the taste was very lacking. The caramelized sugar tasted burnt and had a slight bitterness to it. The donut itself and the creme barely had any taste. It wasn't too sweet (which is a bonus for me) but it wasn't too ANYTHING. Im kind of disappointed and I've definitely had better donuts for cheaper prices. On a positive note, very cute inside and service was great! Parking can be a bit tricky--the parallel parking available near the store is all pay-to-park",donut-bar-las-vegas

16479,https://www.yelp.com/biz/donut-bar-las-vegas,4,9/9/2016,"So 200 plus reviews later not sure anything else can add.....but here we go anyway. I am just about positive am the last yelper that I know in Vegas that finally checked out Donut Bar. I noticed recently Donut Bar has started to open maybe once month or random times at night. So was like NICE finally get to try the pop tart and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. All the videos seen of the creme brÃ»lÃ©e and one of the stables pop tart looked delicious. I do love my donuts from time to time. I heard that generally there a line when first open and the earlier get here the better. The later you come not really the best idea cause they make only so much donuts everyday and by the end slim pickings (truth nothing worst then stale donut). I got down little earlier because not sure where the place was and parking downtown flat out sucks. Honest if you park near Donut Bar they have self pay parking meters. If ur lucky depending time of day its SUPER easy and cost is cheaper then paying any hotel or parking structure. Dollar on the meter gives you hour. More then enough time (maybe if the line is long then that another story). I was surprise but the line was not that bad only four people ahead of me. Just the fact there was LINE for donut shop still blows my mind. Donut Bar does carry strong name brand. Chef Jeff is not only a passionate owner. The guy knows his donuts and all positive vibes. The minute he open the door greeting all five or six of us come on in. Friendly, all smiles, and love the atmosphere. The smell was awesome minute walked in!!! Fresh batch of donuts, the display case truly gives the donuts even more eye candy, the diversity crazy (oversize homer donut, rectangle pop tart, small circle creme brÃ»lÃ©e, traditional size ones but nothing traditional with the flavors or colors, and untraditional ones with donut cones fill with ice cream or strawberry split), and it long line of donut goodies. You might forget the selection at the top of the line. The place is small so gets filled up fast if want sit down. It located literally next to Carson Kitchen or look for the famous Donut Bar sign outside. The stumpton cold crew deserves shout out. I never had that brand before. I decided try the coconut flavor cold brew in carton. It was perfect compliment go with the donuts. They have other flavors. I believe one was chocolate and the other not sure. They also offer it on tap if you like. The donuts the pop tart is HUGE. If one person can eat one that pretty good. The way pop tart melting into the donut not sure if tasted any of the crust associate with pop tart. The filling you know if fan of pop tart is true and true. The icing and the goodies on top just pushed it sugar overload. I loved it. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was good. I think that one better eat it on the spot cause the longer it sits the crack on top break it apart. Rock solid. I had fill out my box was got strawberry split. The strawberries was fresh, juicy, and I keep thinking strawberry shortcake.",donut-bar-las-vegas
15553,https://www.yelp.com/biz/churn-phoenix-3,5,9/9/2016,Visited this cute ice cream shop that is attached to Windsor. I love the variety of flavors that they have! You are able to sample anything that you'd like. I got a single split scoop of the Almond Joy and the chocolate mint. You can also add toppings like toasted marshmallow fluff as well. The ice cream is delicious and extremely flavorful. I highly recommend coming here especially after having a meal at Windsor.,churn-phoenix-3

I had no idea there was no seating and it was an order up place. Guess I should have read some reviews. Let me clarify there was a few benches that a bunch of kids were jumping off of and their clueless parents didn't care. Another annoying thing was the sign location of their flavor choices...TO ALL PARENTS: please be advised that when you prop you child or children on the counter in front of this sign it makes it very difficult for other to view. Staff was friendly and the four flavors we sampled were amazing! Just wish I was able to enjoy it not sitting on a curb with tons of kids around.,handels-homemade-ice-cream-and-yogurt-las-vegas-3

I only recently visited Amelies for the very first time. My daughter is a hair stylist in NoDa and asked if I'd go with her to grab some french pastries on her lunch break. I was so delighted by the atmosphere with chandeliers and colorful decor. They have plenty of parking and many delicious pastries, sandwiches, soups, quiches and salads to offer! I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to see the whole menu however I believe they also offer a great selection of coffee and beverages. My fruit tart was amazing! The only complaint I have is that it was very busy and the line was really long so it took awhile just to order food, then had to wait for it to be prepared and brought out to us. We spent 30 minutes in total, and was only expecting a quick 10-15 minute stop to grab some take out. If you are in a rush, be sure to allow a little more time to get thru the line, and I'm sure they are always very busy at the lunch hour, which is when I went.

I tried their raisin pain and the latte. The pain was surprisingly light and flaky, not too buttery although I'm sure it's layered with butter. The latte was good but I recommend 2 shots to balance out the milk. You also must try the fresh squeezed OJ. Unfortunately, it comes in large size only but I finished most of it, it was that good. For these 3 things, my tab was around $18, I think. It's pricey but everything is jacked up on the strip. I recommend the croissants, plain or chocolate. I'm not a fan of the strawberry croissant. It was mushy and too sweet (basically croissant topped with strawberry jam and dusting of powdered sugar). I will not be ordering that again.

The strawberry ice cream is unbelievably smooth and creamy. It has just the right amount of sweetness and tartness from the frozen bits of strawberry. Best of all, this place is very reasonably priced compared to Sweet Moses or Mitchell's. I recently found out that they offer an even smaller portion than the junior, dubbed the ""golf ball"" for only $1!

It was the last thing we did and a GREAT ending to our weekend in the city. This location is perfect from the space to the ice cream. The first thing I noticed was how you can see the ice cream being made behind the glass from where you order your ice cream. It reminded me of Willy Wonka. Employees were definitely working hard and it was cool knowing where your ice cream is coming from. Aside from the kitchen area, the building is huge! I think my friend mentioned it used to be a theater. There are two floors and each has plenty of tables and chairs to enjoy your treats. It's decorated very plain, yet extremely modern. The ice cream is some of the best I've had! They had countless flavors, some unique and some more traditional. I had peanut butter chocolate chunk. It was peanut butter flavored ice cream with chocolate chunks mixed in. One scoop (they were very generous) on a cake cone was a little over $3. Great price!

First of all, I think they are too large. In my opinion, macarons should be a bit smaller unless you're absolutely sure you can get them right. The ratio of cookie to filling was too high, which made them a bit dry. The mint choc chip was decently flavored, but it reminded me a bit of toothpaste. The cookie was a bit too mushy. The passion fruit was a disaster. The filling tasted like buttery egg, and it was only very very slightly passionfruity. All in all, these are low on the list of macarons for me, and they were also the most expensive by volume.

For local standards their bread is better than the horrors of American store-bought bread. I bought two baguette loaves at Willy Street Coop on Thursday evening. By Friday morning the baguettes were hard. This tells me that the bread was either already a day old when I bought it, or they don't know what they are doing. I spent three years in Germany and toured around Europe. Fresh baguettes do not behave like this. Batch Backhouse cannot match Madison Sourdough or Clausen's. The Baguette had large holes; it didn't really taste like anything. I would think it hadn't been given enough time to rest and develop flavor through longer fermentation, or like they hadn't started with a great yeast starter. Don't forget to bring lots of cash. These people will rob you blind and will not pay their suppliers a fair price for their inputs. The product at Willy Street cost $2.75 per loaf. The Batch Store charges $3.75 per loaf. Madison Sourdough is $3.50 per loaf and it looks larger. It is also sourdough, which is much better than what Batch offered. The girl at Batch said they only use the finest ingredients, (produced by Norwegian bachelor farmers). I asked her what the farmers got for a bushel of wheat, and she didn't know, and I told her I thought Batch was making very rich profits. I asked her if she knew the cost to make a loaf vs. the sales price. She didn't know the cost to produce a loaf. In conclusion, The Baguettes of Batch are not good at all - Suggest one buys their breads at Madison Sourdough - Much, much better product at a cheaper price.

We walked in around 9P and a friendly face greeted us before even stepping foot in the outdoor dining area. I tasted the carrot cake, cookies & cream & they were soo delicious! The flavors were just bursting in your mouth! I ordered a scoop of each and could not wait to go outside and enjoy it on the picnic tables. I was raving about this place as soon as I sat down. From the adorable dÃ©cor to the friendly service, the mouthwatering ice cream and the adorable little Chinese take out box it comes in topped with a fortune cookie. And then BAM(!!!!) half way thru my cookies and cream scoop..... a piece of hair. I was literally off that chair & in my car in 5 seconds. I was DISGUSTED.

I also wanted to get the seasonal orange one, but I had my work cut out for me just eating those 6 alone. I actually didn't eat them as soon as I bought them, I refrigerated a few of them for about a day and they were still amazing! They were crisp on the outside and slightly doughy in the middle. They weren't overly sweet either. My favorite was probably either the pistachio or coffee flavored ones. I also got the red velvet cupcake, since so many others seemed to really like it. I didn't care for it that much. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The cupcake is hollowed out and filled with their cream cheese frosting and it was just a bit too much frosting for me.

Something light and airy or something sweet and heavy. Regardless, it'll leave your mouth watering. If you're looking for something more savory, the roast beef on croissant is TO DIE FOR, and their soups are excellent, especially the french onion.

During my stay, I tried the chocolate pudding (3 layers of different flavors, creamy and heavenly and just the right size for a snack), a (huge) raspberry macaron (a bit too sweet but lovely smooth consistency), pain au chocolat (flaky and delicious, with the perfect amount of smooth chocolate chunks inside), and a carrot cake cookie (2 huge cookies, very soft and cake-like, with amazing cream cheese frosting inside). Service was fine, pretty fast and not at all snotty - if anything, it was the opposite (one woman who helped me pronounced everything incorrectly - it's macaRON NOT macaROON).

You get the feel that buddy is not too hands on with this location. Some of the pastry decorating is below the standards your would expect from Carlos's but none the less still delicious. I have to take my hat off to the front of the house staff because they are very helpful and professional regardless of the mad house. You will definitely be standing in line for a while so be prepared sometimes they will give samples which softens the blow of the long stand lol. Another cool move by buddy is right across from this location you can go eat at his Italian restaurant for dinner which never looks crowded.,carlos-bakery-las-vegas-3

As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places. AmÃ©lie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile. The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves.

So despite a bunch of discouraging reviews on Yelp, I said, ""Nah man, it was probably hyped up, I'll give it a chance..."" I mean for $7.50 for soft serve and cornflakes on top? I wasn't impressed, simply because the flavor doesn't match the value(price) And soft serve should be the easiest thing to execute. Glad I didn't get anything more expensive. But the Cake Truffle was DYNOMITE! But for $6 bucks for 3 pieces... It might just have to be a one time thing. I'm a fan of Masterchef and Christina Tosi has a great rep especially in baking... but this is HYPE. The soft serve is not the one and you'll be more satisfied grabbing a shake at Holsteins instead of here. Dining in the Cosmo can burn a hole in a wallet real fast.

I absolutely love Cake Boss and every time I watch it I'm always drooling over the cakes and desserts so when I found out he had a bakery in Vegas I knew I had to try it out. The line was pretty long when we got here, I think we waited 30-40 minutes but it was definitely worth it. The bakery is very small and they have a few people taking orders but only two cashiers so this could be why the line takes so long. They have about 4 cases full of yummy desserts, they have a variety of cupcakes, cakes and cookies. Of course they have cannolis, their famous ""lobster tail"" pastries among other delectables. I ordered the Salted Caramel Lobster Tail and Cannoli Cake Tower, then we ordered a half a dozen cupcakes to taste. The lobster tail was very good, the saltiness complimented the sweetness of the cream inside and the caramel so it wasn't overly sweet and the pastry was nice and flaky. The cannoli cake tower was so good, there was a thin layer of cake at the bottom with a nice thick layer of cannoli filling in the middle, another thin layer of cake then whipped cream on top. It really didn't need the whipped cream and I wish there was one more layer of cake so everything balanced out but it was still delicious. I would definitely get that again. I also had the salted caramel cupcake and it was very good, the cake was nice and moist, the frosting was light and not to thick, the cupcake was good overall and it wasn't too sweet I was really surprised. I'm glad I was finally able to try this place and it was worth it, I wouldn't come here all the time while in Vegas one because of the line and two they are quite pricey.

I think most people have more fun taking pics & posting it to social media than actually enjoying the darn thing. I am guilty of that. I'm a bit depressed about the thought of having paid $7.50 for just okay ice cream. The soft serve is $6 for a tiny cup plus a dollar more to add the Cornflake Crunch topping so with tax it came out to $7.58. For that price I am okay with not having it ever again. If it was mind blowing good I would not mind paying that price again. I also thought the pre-packaged cookies might make good gifts to bring home for future trips but, nope. There are much better things out there for that. Maybe you need to eat Milk Bars cookies as soon as you buy them? I was too full to 'sample' right away so I didn't get to try them until after I returned home so this review is not exactly thorough or precise. The Compost Cookie has a coffee flavor so avoid if you don't like coffee. The Corn Cookie is like a sweet, chewy cornbread in cookie form that was quite interesting.

We used both an iPhone and a Samsung to map this and it was super confusing on both, and no one who worked at the hotels seemed to know where it was. These pastries were expensive. When we got back to our room it was clear they had not been refrigerated, which is fine for cookies but I am fairly certain that buttercream should be refrigerated. The cake tasted ok but not great. I put my cake in the room's fridge and ate it the next day. It tasted better cold, but there was still the issue of it not being refrigerated in the first place. The cake was fairly bland. I got the rainbow cake and felt like it could have had more flavor. But it tasted like basic white cake and food coloring. For the amount of time it took us to find this place, and for around $8 for one slice, it should have tasted more exciting. I bought my son a cookie, sugar cookie with sprinkles. It was $3. Which was the least expensive thing there. But I've purchased the same type of cookie at a Mexican bakery for 50¢, super I wasn't thrilled about spending so much money on a child's cookie, but prices weren't clearly visible and there is pressure to order quickly. My friend ordered a cup of milk. She got about 8 oz or milk. They charged her about $3. Which is more than the price for a gallon of milk. They also gave her milk that was sitting on the counter (God only knows how long it was unrefrigerated), the last bit from the jug, and mixed it with a new jug of milk. This probably only creeps me out to mix milk, but I thought I would add it since I am on a roll.

Okay. Just 3 times. The creme.brulee is a vegan donut that has a candy like carmelized consistency on top of it with a vegan made custard in that sucker. It's my fave out of all the donuts! For some reason when I bite into it-it reminds me of a Filipino dessert. Sometimes the top may taste a bit burnt minus it actually being burnt. You'll know what I mean when you try it. Weekends they give away free themed donuts to the kiddos. Nothing like seeing your 3 year old elated to bite into an angry bird, minion, or even an avenger. But nothing like imagining a parents face knowing your child is about to bite into his last chunk of sugar for the month. Lol. I'm afraid to admit I've tried a lot of the stuff they have to offer and overall, think they're all right. Nothing worth setting your alarm to, although, coming in early would be ideal because duh...the fresher the better. Everyone knows going to any kind of bakery towards closing won't get the best bite. The big poppa tart donut they're raved about or known for is all right...says the person who can tolerate only so little sugar in one sitting. The one I've had was actually dry. =/ Overall, I'd still pop in on a Saturday morning with the fam...take our our donuts then walk over to the container park where the kids can release the sugar they just swallowed. Makes for a nice morning with the fam. It's worth giving it a try. I prefer this spot over Pink Box for sure...mainly because of their vegan. I dont think theyre one of those must cross the desert for. If you happen to be by and feel like a donut, then definitely give them a try.

I'm a sucker for all baked goods and coffee, and this place is open (and busy) at all hours, so it's a perfect spot after a concert.

I've yet to try anything that I didn't like. The tarts are wonderful, and I don't know anywhere else to get French macarons. (I've read other reviews that suggested the French macarons are too tough or hard; mine had a perfectly crisp outer layer and spongy interior.) The eclairs are excellent as well. I love croissants, and these don't disappoint. One downside: the price of the pastries and baked goods. A bite-sized tart runs $2.50, and a 4 inch tart is $4.50. Macarons are $2.50 per cookie. The coffee and tea are great and very reasonably priced (much cheaper than Starbucks and a little cheaper than many other cafes). The baristas are quick and prepare the coffee well. The menu food is decent as well. It's not what I come here for, though. The only other negative is that the service is much less friendly than the typical cafe. The employees are so concerned with moving the line quickly that they get snippy if you have a question (especially about flavors or prices of items that aren't labeled).

The frosting was really good, and I liked how there was a glob of frosting in the middle of the cupcake as well. If you are a frosting whore like me, you'll love it! On Monday we decided to try the Fruit Tart, this was actually my favorite, but I am a huge Fruit Tart fan. It was topped with kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, peaches, and a fig! The fig was pretty tasty and unique. The custard was quite delicious and went well with the tasty crust. I have to admit I ate most of this one, sorry sweetie! On Tuesday we had the Dark Chocolate Cupcake, this one was my GFs favorite, she loves dark chocolate so this one was all her. I thought it was good but I like milk chocolate better than the dark. This cupcake also had the glob of dark chocolate frosting in the middle of the cake. So overall they were all good, I rank it Fruit Tart, Red Velvet,and Dark Chocolate.

It's also a little cheaper than some other boba places around here. Every time I've been here, the staff have been exceptionally nice. That, coupled with how quickly they make drinks, is what really makes them a five star establishment in my eyes.

After a trip to the West Side Market, my wife and I swung by Mitchell's on a warm summer Saturday afternoon at 12pm, which seemed like the perfect timing. The ice cream shop had just opened 30 minutes prior and there weren't many people inside, so we took our time exploring the menu and flavors. From the moment people spot Mitchell's you can tell it's just different. For one, the outside looks like the entrance to a movie theater. Once customers make their way in, they're greeted by a huge glass window straight ahead where you can see into their ice cream making facility. However, what customers really need to focus on is the writing and menu on the glass window, which is not only written in a light white, but incredibly hard to see. I won't dock them any stars for that snafu, but maybe making it a bit darker would have helped, however I get that they want to showcase the factory behind the glass. Anyway, we surveyed the flavors at the ordering counter and the options. We tend to make the mistake of over-ordering, but also what to try as much as we can, so what better option than the Taster's Duo, which is supposed to be a single scoop of 2 different flavors. After being enlightened by the very helpful employees there about their most popular and favorite flavors, my wife ordered the Strawberry Rhubard and Fresh Peach on a sugar cone, while I ordered the Toasted Pistachio and Caramel Fudge Brownie, with the latter supposedly being their most in demand flavor. The verdict? EXCELLENT. The ice cream wasn't too soft and had very good texture to it. The flavors were really good and we loved each and every bite. The Strawberry Rhubard and Fresh Peach were fruity, but savory. The Toasted Pistachio and Caramel Fudge Brownie were sweet, but not overpowering. The Caramel Fudge Brownie had large chunks of brownie inside of the ice cream, which I loved. Overall, the ice cream was delicious and perfect. What was even better was how generous the scoops were. We ordered the Taster's Duo, which was supposed to be 2 half scoops, but when we received our cones, the ice cream was overloaded. It looked like they had given us 2 gigantic single scoops of each flavor we ordered. In addition, the Taster's Duo was just $3.95, which is unheard of these days for ice cream from a shop. I guess we felt we really got our money's worth too because we basically got 2 scoops instead of one.

The flavors blended well together and was absolutely delicious! The other had vanilla bean and nutella topped with red velvet macaron and marshmallow. I'm sure it would be good on its own but, the combo just didn't quite taste as good. Service was exceptional! The lady behind the counter graciously let us sampled limitlessly.

This location does seem a little pricier than what I remember in NYC but it has been a while so it could have just gone up over the years. The milk soft serve w/cornflakes is my go to. I think of this soft serve as what you would expect with ""milk"" flavor so don't expect it to be super savory and rich like ice cream. Honestly, I can see how it can be a little bland to some people since it's not on the sweeter side, but the saltiness of the cornflakes adds the needed flavor for my preferences. I think a small is enough to share between too people as well. Last but not least, def try the crack pie. It's pricey for a slice and a whole can run you $52+ but if you're feeling like a treat your self mood this is the thing to get.

Next in the middle of the chaos of of the counter staff takes a large circular tray/plate to arrange cookies to take across the street (maybe for a restaurant or something.

Second, the crumb, which is supposed to be moist from the milk soak, was dry and crumbly to the point that it broke apart under the weight of the fork. Third, the cake layers were flavorless.

The atmosphere is actually the worst thing I have ever come across, especially for a restaurant attempting to be trendy. Silver garland that changes color should stay at my great-aunt's Christmas party, not a restaurant. Mismatched wood wall accents EVERYWHERE make the place look like the designer stopped at a lumber liquidation sale and bought everything, whether it went together or not. The seashell tiling is atrocious and doesn't fit the vibe at all, if one can even call the aesthetic of this place a vibe. And who thinks velvet seating with RHINESTONES is okay for any restaurant that caters to anyone older than 6? And super limited seating, but I didn't want to stay in the place long enough to deal with it. 2. The wait was ridiculous for having ordered one basic crepe with absolutely no line in front of me. I had to stay in the hell hole way too long for comfort. 3. Finally, the food. It was mediocre, if I'm trying to be nice. My real issue was the pricing of it, though. You'd think that for $7.50 you'd at least get two scoops of ice cream. There's a little scoop of ice cream on the top, but it wasn't proportionate to the amount of crepe I had to eat. The crepe was shaped like an ice cream cone, so once the small amount of ice cream was eaten, you were left with a dry, plain crepe. Needless to say, I will not be returning.

The staff was so friendly when I called in to see if they had anymore, they even went ahead and made me a couple extra with the left over decorations they had in stock. I loved them for that reason. Well and because their cupcakes are awesome. Their location in Las Vegas is touristy, mostly because it is at the Linq hotel and casino right in their promenade. Mostly.Mostly tourists are going here but sometimes they have locals around or local specials so you need to check. Also they have different flavors on different days, so if you are seeking a special flavor make sure to call first for availability. For example on Monday they have strawberry, but on Tuesday they have banana, but not strawberry, on Wednesday they have a limited edition pumpkin spice BUT no banana, and so on. You get the idea. Parking is easy here, plus it is free and close by to the promenade. They are open long hours and the inside smells delicious and is super clean!

There are so many ways to enjoy your Handel's, from a classic cone to shakes, sundaes, hurricanes, and even take home pints and quarts. The 4 scoop sampler is such a steal, especially if you can't make up your mind when choosing flavors. Speaking of which, there are an insane amount to choose from. Make sure to check out the other pictures and signs they have posted on their doors for others they may have added. You won't find many other ice cream shops or grocery stores offering these unique flavors and they honestly give Ben & Jerry's, Baskin-Robbins, or really any other one of your favorite brands a run for their money. They're creamy, rich, and last pretty long so they won't melt too fast before you can enjoy. Even with the overwhelming choices, Handel's makes getting great tasting and high quality ice cream super simple.

They usually have about 10-15 flavors to choose from, some are always available, while others are seasonal or only available on certain days of the week. I don't generally buy cupcakes because I like to bake, and most of the time they are dry, or taste fake, or just aren't very good, but I make an exception for Sprinkles 'cause they are pretty dang tasty. They aren't the best cupcakes ever, but they are very good. They are always moist, and they are generous with their frosting. My friends and I pre-ordered about 35 or 40 cupcakes, all different flavors. They were for several different people, and Sprinkles was kind enough to give us extra boxes so we could disperse them as needed. They also have puppy cupcakes which is about the best thing ever! They are smaller than their regular (human) cupcakes and super cute. My Great Dane loved hers. I've been told you can order a frosting shot, which I've never tried, but am very tempted to do.

The churro was crunchy and freshly made. The ice cream was very soft and melted very quickly. I was very disappointed by this place. Had higher expectations from Yelp. I sampled: 1. Captain Crunch: Tasted like captain crunch but a bit sweet 2. Mint chocolate chip: Impressive since they use fresh mint which you can taste, but overpowering for me 3. Apple cider sorbet: Soft, tasted like apple sauce even the texture 4. Bakalava: Very flavourful bit did not like the heavy amount of pastry in just the sample! 5. Same cake-like flavour: Okay flavour, bit heavy. Ended up getting small 2 scoop ($4): 6. Taro: Good flavour, not the purple colour you get other places. 7. Earl grey: Tasted like the tea. Nice flavour. ******Reason why I give 2 star: Good flavours initially, but overtime I tasted the heavy oily cream texted on the roof of my mouth. I hate that feeling, too much oil from the cream.

I used to live across the street and my room mate and I ended up here far too often. CS's super-premium ice cream is as rich and creamy as you'd expect, and they have case after case of flavors. I am a bad decider, so it often takes me several minutes of pacing up and down the store to choose what I want. On my last trip some visiting friends and I were on a milkshake mission - I chose to do a Zanzibar chocolate malt. Delicious, for sure, but not quite malty enough - the Zanzibar chocolate has such a bold flavor that it overwhelmed the warmth of the malt. No worries, though - it turns out pure liquid chocolate is still delicious. Crazy, right? Last month I tried one of their new flavors, banana cream pie. Banana ice cream, Nilla wafters, and marshmallow sauce. Yum. Yes. I'll have another scoop, please. In addition to their regular ice cream, Chocolate Shoppe also offers BANG!! ice cream (one scoop has the same amount of caffeine as an energy drink) and several non-dairy options (that I might try so as to pretend I'm making a 'healthy' choice).

The atmosphere instantly takes you into relax mode, this is an ideal place to study or read. They were out of a few items, which only shows the quality of the food and the freshness of the product- if they only order a minimum amount at once, you know that it's going to be as fresh as can be. The sandwiches were wonderful, but we found them lacking only in a side item. A small fruit or green salad, or an offer of a bag of chips would have made the meal seem complete. Instead, we went back and ordered a side salad and bowl of crab soup to share. The bowl of soup was a meal in itself, the portion was very generous, and incredible! It was a tomato-y bisque with a little heat and a good amount of crab, with a few slice of french bread. The salad we took togo, because the soup was too delicious to let go to waste. We also shared two of the mini key lime tarts which were fabulous! My only complaint would be that the pricing is a little high for single items, if the sandwiches/soups/salads came with a small accompaniment, I would have no problem with the pricing, because the food was delicious.

First they don't honor your Yelp freebies AND they have an attitude AND the vegan coconut ice cream tastes like sugar water. No flavor at all. AND it's EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE. The young lady taking my order, must have been in a place where she couldn't hear what I ordered. I looked at the menu board and thought I ordered a cup with one scoop of ice cream and another cup with two scoops of ice cream. I also had a free topping. She distinctly told me that chocolate chips could not be ""swirled ""in. I had no idea what she was talking about. I said OK put the chocolate chips on the side; that's OK for me. She shook her head yes. I ordered two scoops of ice cream for my other half. And we were supposed to get another free topping with our Yelp Check-in. Then she rang up my bill at $15.86. I thought well four dollars for one scoop and six dollars for two scoops... How does that equal $15.86? I showed the cashier the bill and she re-rang it up as $11.86. Another little girl from behind the counter came up, looked at my receipt and just said: ""Nooooooooooo...."" while shaking her head. I was still confused but I went ahead and went with it. I found out later (from watching and listening to other customers ordering) what they do is they take the topping and mix it in through some machine and charge a whole lot more money for that. But how was I supposed to know that was my first time there. My advice is ask questions before ordering. Especially if it's your first time; because nothing was explained to us and it was our first time. I personally will never come back here. To me a customer and their service to a customer should come first.

She should have said that at the time she nodded at both check ins. While the ice cream is great- its not worth the price when there are soooo many choices in the area.

I can honestly say I still love there sandwiches, the 90's style names are great, I had the Carlton and the Uncle Jessy. They even changed the shop a little since my last review in the way that the sandwich menu is now out in the shop on a board like the Ice Cream and I was able to get a sandwich past 8:00 p.m. I'm absolutely in love with the thin mint cookie dough pops now that I've tried one, I'm in love with the regular cookie dough bits candy and it's like the bigger flavored version of one of those, so of course I love it. I even went back twice that day, which is how I ended up trying a second sandwich for a late dinner. I wasn't expecting to go back, but I ended up picking my friend/roommate up from her late class and then she complained about Charlotte not having any good milkshake places open... I wasn't sure where she got that, but I remember that Ninety's probably had milkshakes and decided to make a quackish stop there for her. They did have milkshakes and she loved every second of the frosting rolled milkshake. She's definitely a fan now and we will be going back.",ninety-s-milkshake-bar-charlotte

Days later and back in the Midwest I am gorging on the goodies and dreaming of Bouchon. Such classy and excellent staff, so helpful and friendly. Late hours at a bakery? Phenomenal! And that damn good cup of coffee. Now. Macarons. Some are small and crisp me skimpily slithered with succulent jam. Others wear a brittle meringue hat and one may find the head within that hat a bit chewy and dense. These varieties may be daubed generously with supple sensuous buttercream--never overly-sweet. Bouchon has the latter sort. I tried Black Forest, coffee, salted caramel, chocolate covered pistachio, and pumpkin. All amazing, some more or less so. I also destroy---er, I mean I ate a better nutter and a tko (aka Thomas Keller Oreo). The two sandwich cookies were deliriously delicious. Like a transcendental experience. Full body bliss. No joke.

The ice cream is creamy, it's light, it's fluffy, it's addicting and it's really just everything you think about in an ice cream. The other reviews explain the ice cream to the core, so I won't go too into detail about the flavors, but I will say that my two favorites for now are the chocolate brownie and of course, the salted Carmel. Put them together and it's definitely 'ice cream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for-Sweet Republic-ice cream-sweetness.' Here's another special treat to Sweet Republic. Their heavenly toffee! It could be the best toffee I've ever had. In fact, I think I'm going to deem it the best toffee I've had to-date. The almond toffee is buttery, crunchy and soft all together. I put it on top of my salted Carmel ice cream, forgot about every calorie I was consuming and enjoyed sweet moments of Sweet Republic bliss. The bacon brittle intrigued me and I must say, I wasn't too eager to try it. But, after reading about it so often, I had to give it a whirl and was happily surprised! The bacon taste definitely overtakes the taste of the toffee making it taste like you are eating bacon with an infused taste of left-over syrup from your pancakes. Actually, I bet it would taste pretty good on top of waffles or pancakes! So with that, I will end the 241st review of Sweet Republic.

My son decided on the latter and I opted for two scoops on a waffle cone. I proceeded to order when the girl tells me that I cannot get two scoops of two different flavors. She stated they go by serving size. I stood there with a confused look on my face. Okay, so I cannot get two scoops with two different flavors? Isn't a scoop a serving size? I'm confused. She said no, then went on to explain their serving size. Again I was a little confused. Whether it be scoops or serving size, she made it seem as if I could not get two different ones on a cone. Her explanation was a little weird to me, thus leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Especially after looking over to the gentleman next to me, walking away with two different scoops on a regular cone.

What I liked - the salted caramel brownie, which in no way resembles a brownie, but is very sweet and satisfying. I still have a small chocolate mousse waiting for sampling, and am just gonna give it the benefit of the doubt. What I didn't like - the rest of the pastry selection I sampled really suffered (but I'm a fighter, and I am gonna keep trying!!). The cream puff was several days old, it might have been better had in made recently but the one I had was quite stale. The same problem with the cherry turnover, I think this would be very nice if it had been fresh. But I won't order this one again. The chocolate croissant was just unfortunate. Whomever had made the croissant, or maybe served it, had been working with asiago cheese previously. So my chocolate croissant had a very distinct asiago cheese flavor - not good, not good at all.

I have never written a review but had to do it now. My daughter is turning 16 on Sunday. She is a vegan. I searched the Internet looking for an establishment that would make a two tiered vegan birthday cake. I found the Butterwood. They were closed the day I found them, however, their website allowed for online orders. I placed my order on a Tuesday (they processed my $144), and I emailed that same day asking if I would be able to speak to someone about my order (i wanted to make sure that I could get the cake for that Sunday because I didn't indicate that when I ordered...there wasn't a space for that, and I realized that after placing the order) In the email I said that I would call during their business hrs. I called the following day (wed) and spoke with one of the workers and asked all of my Q's. She assured me that they could have it for me on Sunday. My next questions were about the decorations on the cake; I asked if they could write happy 16th birthday on it. She said that they only decorated with fresh flowers and do not write on them. She said she would speak to her MGR and ask If they would make an exception. She took my name and number and said she would get back to me. I never received a call. So, I called back on Thursday. I spoke with a different employee who found the note that was written with my Q's. I explained to her that nobody called me back, as they said they would. She explained to me that her manager had been in New York all week.She said I could have the cake by Sunday but didn't know that they could decorate like I asked; she said she would text her MGR, and someone would get back to me. I asked her to get back to me ASAP because if I decided not to go with them I would need 48 hrs notice to order from Whole Foods. She assured me someone would get back to me. After thinking about the decorations and talking with friends and family, I figured I would just continue with the order. So, I didn't give it another thought, figuring I would just pick it up on Sunday. I was telling a friend of mine what type of cake and from where, and the backstory and she suggested I call to make sure all was in order because of the lack of , As she said, professionalism with never returning calls. So, I called sat afternoon, only to be told that they can't fulfill the order at all...no cake, even with flowers on it. Whaaaaat?!?!? I explained everything to her and she said she was sorry but the employees I spoke to should have known, and shouldn't have taken my order because they haven't been taking orders for a couple of months and this was indicated on the website. I explained to her that I spoke with two of her employees on two separate occasions that assured me I could have that cake for Sunday, and when I placed the order they took my $144, as I said early. I explained again that I would have needed 48 hours notice to get a vegan cake from Whole Foods, as I told her employee previously (she told me she was the manager that was in New York). I explained that I could not get a vegan cake to serve enough people on such short notice. And all she said was I'm sorry! I asked if there was anything she could do to help. All I got was a no! Nothing to try to help fix this; their mistake, their error, their lack of professionalism! Now I have no cake for my daughter who is having many friends and family over to celebrate her sweet 16!

After having served the 2 groups that had ordered after us, we started to watch the 3 workers behind the counter to see if they were making our split. This is when we noticed they were standing there chatting (not working) about their social lives. Not a huge deal to be served after but when they finally made our split, what they presented us with was a Banana Split in 4 different containers for us to take with us. WHAT????

It's only a 25 minute drive from my place; much better than the 4 hours. Yay!! Now for the pros and cons list to make things easier for me and for anyone reading this. Pros: 1. Of course all the delicious, soft and fluffy baked goods. My favorites are the brioche, boroh danish, taro swirl bun, Hokkaido cheese tart and coconut twist. And the bf likes all the savory ones; jalapeÃ±o and cream cheese, hot dog buns, spicy sausage and ham and cheese. 2. Due to COVID-19, all the pastries are already wrapped individually. I find this a lot easier than the old way. With things already wrapped, you're not waiting forever at the register for the cashier with their dirty hands to wrap all your pastries one by one. 3. I loooove their coffee with sea salt foam!! It's so good and gives you a nice boost for your day. Cons: 1. It's located in Chinatown. I hate Chinatown. People can't drive and Spring Mountain is terrible. It's located in a new busy plaza so good luck finding a parking spot during the weekend. 2. Why is this place soooo tiny?!? All the other locations I've been to in Cali have been much bigger and spacious. With all the money they make, you'd think they could afford bigger real estate. 3. Speaking of small spaces, forget about social distancing. With customers constantly moving around looking at all the bread, you're literally standing next to someone all the time. And of course there's that one customer who has no sense of their surroundings and takes 19 years to move out of the way. 4. The line gets long really quick, and of course, the not-so-smart customer doesn't know where to go and cuts in front of everyone. Why are people so clueless?!?! *sighs in exasperation Of course I'll make the drive to the dreaded Chinatown for this place. And if you're not a fan of 85°, that's fine by me. Less people in my way.

After I ordered the food she asked me if I wanted the Sunday with the hot food and I told her I would get that separate. I am not sure how many orders they get for food because this took quite a while. When I finally got it I was pretty impressed with the burger though. It was nicely cooked and had good bread. The fries were a bit limp and not crisp like they should be, but I was o.k. with that. I went back to get the Yinzer sunday because it is one of my favorites. Vanilla ice cream with a blondie brownie, caramel syrup, wipped cream and nuts on top. It is quite lovely and more than one person can typically handle. Drawbacks to Page: The location of this place is a disaster that always happens. This is because it is right at the corner of where 2 busy roads meet(West Carson and Becks Run Road). You pull in off of Carson and no one knows where to go when they are leaving. There is no set way of doing things. When you leave, where do you go? If you try to go back the way you came onto Carson there is traffic stopped at the light blocking your path and other traffic coming in the next lane. You can circle around onto Becks Run Road, but you will have to wait for traffic to stop moving coming from Becks, which takes forever, or they will be stopped at the light on the other side of the corner and you will have to wait for that also. Either way it makes for a very akward visit. And this is when it is not so busy, if it is busy expect more confusion and utter chaos.

Once we got back to the hotel and try some other stuff, it was pretty good but it's not worth on the $40 that we spend on everything.

Next time, I will be pairing it with the oatmeal cookie. The oatmeal cookie sample I had was really good, not as good as the blueberry muffin but still good. It was a mild oatmeal cookie flavor it would have gone nicely with the blueberry muffin. The cookie doh one that I did get was aight. It was kinda boring in comparison to the blueberry and I don't know if I honestly would have liked it any better alone. In it's defense, I'm not a huge cookie dough fan.

To be fair, I am not very interested in their specialty treats - the macaron ice cream sandwiches or cookie dough pops.I just tried a good old-fashioned waffle cone with two flavors - moose tracks and some peanut butter pretzel something (the scooper mumbled the flavor name and I heard peanut butter so I went for it). Both flavors were solid - the moose tracks had an insane amount of fudge in it (delicious but honestly a little too much for me) and the peanut butter element of the other flavor was just enough. My friend got the brownie milkshake which was definitely underwhelming. If I go back, I'll try a more exciting milkshake with the edible rim. Otherwise, Two Scoops still wins best ice cream in Charlotte. I gave them four stars for their unique offerings in which I happen to have limited interest. There's gotta be hype for a reason, right?!

It was a Friday afternoon and there weren't too many customers so my friend and I got to chose the nice couch. I looked at the available cakes and they all looked so good that I had trouble picking out THE one that I wanted. Once I got my cake, it was gone before I could blink. It was THAT GOOD. I couldn't resist my temptation and got another cake to-go. The interior is very elegant yet not too aloof. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially because my friend had a stomach ache. They brought her hot water and told her to lay down until she felt better to move. Their cake flavors vary day to day, so if you want a specific flavor, I'd say give them a call to ask.

Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e is definitely my favorite and worth coming back for. I love that they have vegan options! I've tried The Big Poppa and Strawberry Split, which are raved about via social media and they aren't bad but elaborate donuts just aren't my thing. So maybe I'm writing this review from a sort of biased stand point. Customer service is on point! Always. Any time, any day. Chef Jeff is fantastic and I love that he is so involved! You can see him here as soon as they open and even during the last few minutes before they close. That speaks volumes to me. The one thing holding me back from giving it a 5 star review is the texture. They are more bread-like in texture and taste vs a traditional donut. When I think of a donut, I think of an almost fluffy, light, fried piece of heaven. It's not heavy (unless it's a cake donut, which in that case.. YUM) but it's not airy either. Am I making any sense? I hope so. That being said, as aforementioned, I have been a repeat customer and will continue to do so in the future. I have a few more vegan ones to try.

Just when I think I've found a new favorite flavor, they put out something new, fun, and inventive, and I have a new favorite. On my most recent trip, we stopped in for a late night treat. The staff was super friendly and chatted with us and pet our dog. They let us try some flavors to help us decide. Honestly, I wanted to try every single flavor, but stopped myself and just tried a couple. I settled on a scoop of cookie butter (!!!!) and a scoop of cocoa puff (with cocoa puff cereal topping). Both flavors were out of this world good. The cookie butter basically tasted like Trader Joe's cookie butter straight out of the jar. And the cocoa puff tasted like chocolate cereal milk, it transported me right back to my childhood. my boyfriend settled on french toast (with a maple syrup topping) and brownie batter. I got a taste of both and they were great. I would definitely recommend the french toast, and the brownie batter was good, not a rich as you would expect, which I really liked. We also split an order of churros, which they brought out to us, just made and still warm. OMG so good. the perfect pairing with that delish ice cream. Bonus, they also gave us a mini scoop of vanilla for our pooch. In an edible cup, in case he decided to eat that too. I thought that was so cool, I love any place that loves dogs. I'm not kidding when I said I wanted to try every flavor. Everything was just so fun and inventive. They have flavors that I've never seen anywhere else, and every single one sounded so good. I'm excited to go back and try the Thai tea flavor. They also have a bunch of vegan flavors, usually at least 3-4 every time I'm there. The vegan strawberry jam is my favorite so far.

Their ice cream is creamy and full of flavor and their artic swirls are filled with all the good stuff, no more digging at the bottom to find the goods! They use Nancy B's decadent cookies, which shows you they care about the quality of what goes in their ice cream! There is usually a line to wait in, no matter what the weather is, because everyone wants a piece of Page's! The only small, teeny tiny issue I have is the location, while there is much history behind it (Refer to windows for newspaper articles), it is dangerous to pull in and out of on the corner of Carson and Becks Run. I got in a horrible accident by someone who hit me coming out of Fagel Street, which is right behind the dairy mart, so just be careful pulling in and out of Page's. Other than that, this place is sure to melt your taste buds! And it is wallet friendly too!

Not that there isn't a place for those, but it isn't at an extremely reputable patisserie. More disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron. It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I can't decide whether I should finish eating it or not. If you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldn't be crunchy at all, not hard, but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it. This macaron, again, tastes a day old, it's hard,crunchy, and too cold. If you haven't had a macaron before, don't have this one or else you'll think macarons themselves are disappointing.

So, I tried one of their chocolate chip cookies -- huge, about the size of 4 normal sized cookies. The flavor was good, not intensely sweet, but I've had better. It could have used larger chunks of chocolate. I also tried the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo). Loved it!

Unfortunately, this specialty item was disappointing. The shell didn't taste crispy fresh, the filling wasn't as creamy as I've had and a little too sweet. The chocolate covering masked the staleness of the cannoli shell, so I liked that one better. The RED VELVET CUPCAKE? Sadly, I've had better here,too. Tasted a few days old, and not very moist.

We interacted with our order taker THREE times, once to take our order, once to show us what she put in the box, then finally to pay for it. 21 min. to get already made goods?!?! Way too long.

Every time I go there is a huge line, dirty plates on every table and a mass of people. My favorite bakery items are the twice baked chocolate croissants. The last few times I've been they were either out of them (that happened twice) or they said they had them and then gave me the twice baked almond croissant by mistake (realized that when I got home) or they had them so I was so excited that I got two! - they were both stale. Really disappointing. Also one night we got a Napoleon to share there, we tried to take a bite of it and it was frozen. I should've said something to one of the people behind the counter but I was just fed up at this point and felt like they wouldn't do anything about it anyways.

On my visit to Charlottee my aim was to find a bakery that fills my caloric need of yumminess. Amelie's did not quite fill my yummy meter, in the sweet side, but the savory side they did. First, the atmosphere makes me want to give it 3.5 stars, but alas decor can only do so much when the baked goods are not up to snuff. But I did enjoy that they have different areas with different styles, and an atrium as well for louder groups. So first of all. My goto caffeine kick is a nonfat latte. Amelie's does not have skim nor lowfat milk. They only have whole & soy milk, and cream. That was already my minus 5 for me. What place that prides themselves of nicely crafted expresso not have nonfat milk? really, je n'sais pas. Anyway, so i pulled myself together because I was honestly in shock to hear this. I actually had to ask twice to make sure I heard her correctly. they have soy, so I had a soy latte. It was delicious, but still. I ordered a egg breakfast croissant sandwich with spinach and asiago cheese. It was yummy. The croissant was perfectly crafted. Not too buttery, it was just amount of flaky. It was not chewy from it being underbaked. The spinach was nothing to speak about, not sure if it was fresh or not. but the egg was cooked well and it was paired nicely with my asiago cheese. Overall, I'd order it again no questions asked. I got 2 items to go. A lemon tea cake and a mixed berry 'tart.' Though the overall tea cake was delicious. It had a nice crumb and beautiful in color and appearance-- it was not at all lemony. All I could really taste was butter. Lemon zest please? Lemon curd? Something? And this mixed berry tart was more muffin to me simply because of the overall texture of it. Tarts to me are dense and buttery. This mixed berry were neither of this things. It was fluffy and I could not even taste the berry. When I bit into it, it resembled a muffin. Pricing wise, I found some of their items a bit overpriced. But again, that is because I was disappointed. I have no issue with paying more if it is delicious and what I expected. The lemon tea cake was probably the size of a slightly larger square golf ball and I think it was almost 2 dollars. Meh, not worth it. I think the tarts were $4 and size wise it was probably the circumference of a average grapefruit and height was probably a little more than 1/2 inch. Again, if it was yummy and tart like I could careless how much it cost. Would I go back to try other items? Absolutely.

Take the escalators down and make a sharp right or left to join line for the shop counter (line window started right across JUICE FARM) Idk if they recently changed the location, but previous reviews mentioned near the palazzo theater, guest elevators etc, but If you don't know where those places are then you might get frustrated like i did. I done lost my mind looking for this counter right behind the escalators that take you up to coffee bean(food court) /parking garage. Pastries were just as good as I remember from the restaurant and the boxes flew home well on my flight home. Standouts- kouighamann : the closest texture I've tried in the states to the ones in France. Dense and buttery- should not be flaky or falling apart into crumbs. Almond croissant: so toasty (even when cold) with good buttery almond filling. Bouchon: a hybrid between a brownie bite and toasted cannele lol. Got a few chocolate chips on the bottom too.",bouchon-bakery-las-vegas-10

The place is really cute and everything looks so good. That's where the positives stop. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and the rainbow cake. I paid 19 bucks and some change and while I wasn't too thrilled about how thin the slices were, I wasn't upset either since. When I bit into the strawberry shortcake, I was hit with this chemical-like, bitter taste. The cake was dry but would dissolve into my mouth into a sludge like consistency. I thought it was me because I was eating it in my hotel room after having dinner and assumed it was my taste buds clashing. After several bites and the flavor not getting any better, I had my best friend try my cake. She gagged. I thought that maybe they might have missed an important ingredient when making the cake so I immediately tried the rainbow cake. The batter tasted bad like the first cake and the icing tasted like the icing one makes when they mix that sugary powder that comes in a gingerbread making kit with water- not horrible but also not high end or worth the money. We tried the confetti cake my friend bought and it was the same thing. I will say, it wasn't as horrible as the cakes I ordered but still not worth the hype. I'm honestly really confused as to how this business has gotten so much positive attention when the cakes aren't edible. I'm definitely curious about the lobster tail and cannoli since that's what everyone on here has recommended. Maybe if I had gotten that, my review would be more positive. I'm definitely not willing to chance it though if I'm ever staying at the Venetian again.",carlos-bakery-las-vegas-3

This is their flagship location and I love this one because you can walk up and down the Ohio City shops and the cute neighborhood area while you're enjoying your treat, or they also had indoor tables (no outdoor dining, at least not this summer). Their staff are very friendly and when this place gets long lines during warm weather, they handle it like pros and get people through so you're enjoying your ice cream desires in no time. Their prices are very reasonable, and at this location you can rent out the second floor for a private party. Their rainbow sprinkles are awesome and plentiful. What they're great at are the fun flavors they think of. Anything that you see that has chunks in it (e.g. cookies and cream) has the perfect amount, very generous. I think the best part is that even the vanilla flavor in the ice cream itself is good.

I've had hojicha at multiple different places and it's usually something I love to get. However, the one at Sweet Republic did not taste like anything I'd had before. The earl grey was similarly strange in the sense that it was overwhelming and not very balanced. I actually just settled for the brownie ice cream because it seemed like the safest choice out of the bunch.

Is it the best bakery in Little Italy? That depends on which local you ask, but it does do plenty right and is a solid Italian bakery, nonetheless. I used to live on E. 120th a thousand years ago and back then, Presti's was a 24 hour hole-in-the-wall donut shop and institution in the neighborhood. Students from CWRU/CIA, residents from UH, and the late night bar crowd all loved having the ability to pick up a dozen hot and fresh donuts in the middle of the night, myself included! When they relocated down the street, the donuts disappeared and the switch to normal business hours was made. I will forever miss this aspect of Presti's, though, so must dock a star out of principle alone. Yes, they really were that good! So, anyway... the ""new"" Presti's is a pretty good bakery and lunch option. It's very popular and if you come during peak hours, be prepared to take a number and wait, though, the line does move fairly quickly. Along with their wide selection of cookies, cakes, pastries and breads, they also serve pizza, sandwiches, salads, paninis and other light fare. Their coffee is always hot and fresh, too!

I had been following them on instagram for a while @masonscreamery and finally got a chance to check them out at the Cleveland Flea and the Tremont Arts Fest. They are a roaming ice cream store that sets up shop at local markets and places, kind of like an ice cream food truck. What I really appreciate about Mason's Creamery are the down to earth owners (Jesse and Helen) who care about their craft and their customers. They are also interested in finding great flavor combinations - ones that feature local Ohioan products like Cleveland Whiskey, Rising Star coffee, paw paw (local Ohio fruit), and other great ingredients.

I haven't had some locally made ice cream since I lived in our small college town in Northern California. After doing some shopping in the vintage shops around Roosevelt Row and sweating like crazy, my friend and I stopped by Melt. We had quite a few samples of their sorbets and ice creams including chips and salsa (with Tapatio on top). The cucumber sorbet was seriously refreshing. But I ended up with a mini-scoop of Peanut Butter. My friend also tried their Mexican Hot Chocolate and did say it was too overly spicy. Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm creamy! This was seriously dreamy. Their ice cream, cultivated by Superstition Farms is incredibly creamy, smooth, and perfectly sweet without being too over the top. All the flavors I tried were very natural and that's a definite plus. You've got to love their scoops come in Chinese take-out boxes topped with a fortune cookie. Better yet, if you don't like your fortune, they have a jar full of them you can switch yours out with. Ha! We spotted their junk food cookies in their case on the way out and were very curious. But we asked the girl working that day (who was a bit of an awkward person who didn't listen to us very well) what was in it, but she couldn't even tell us. Ummmmm, okay? The cookie was HUGE and looked like it may have been some sort of peanut butter oatmeal concoction with potato chips and pretzels piled on top of it. I wish I would have grabbed one up to check it out. Maybe next time! My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on their large patio area. It was a nice quiet Sunday and Roosevelt Row makes for a nice relaxing spot to sit in and admire.",melt-phoenix

I tried vanilla and honey and didn't taste any honey. I did end up getting cream puff flavor which was fine, but nothing to crave or rave about. The flavors have the illusion of being interesting, but are not great flavors. This, of course, is just my opinion.

My first taste of it in New York 2 years ago, sent a friend and I running around the big apple in the wee hours of the night taking multiple trains and walking blocks after blocks through torrential rain, just to get it almost every day we were there. Fast forward to a year later, and they opened one a bit closer to me, in my second home, Vegas. Once again, braving horrible conditions of 110 degree plus weather, and a $7 parking fee, I trucked my ass all the way to the Cosmo from Mandalay Bay and $30 later I had my cereal milk soft serve. They also have a crack pie soft serve, which my friend preferred over the cereal milk. Me, I prefer the original. You can get the soft serve in shake form, which is pretty handy, especially if you are trying to rush back to your car to avoid the parking fee after 1 hour. It's expensive, it's a small serving, and it's worth every penny. That is, if it's your thing. The crack pie, which I also love, tastes a bit stale at the Vegas location. The pie I can do without, especially since it costs something like $10 a slice (ok, more like $6). The cookies are not my favorite. While they are good, they aren't worth the price. The cakes, on the other hand, are definitely worth a try. We ordered a whole birthday cake for my hubby and it was exactly has we hoped it would be. If you like the birthday cake flavor, this is the cake for you. The service from the cashiers is hit or miss. I've had the same, disinterested one several times, and for this price and from a place this popular, I would expect friendlier service. It's borderline rude. I've also had nicer service from other employees, so I can't say it's a consistent problem. All in all, a perfect little place for the Cosmopolitan and it's uber hip and trendy crowd.

Under cooked with very little color and flat tasting. They remind me do the industrial ones at Costco or Starbucks. In fact Starbucks new breakfast fare now rolling out across the country's is better than the croissants at this bakery. The bakers are cutting corners, but there is vey little butter in these croissants and no flavor or texture. So if you are looking for a good French croissant keep driving. Coffee is brewed weak and the blend has little character. The pastries are better and the macaroons quite good. But again nothing special. But clearly I'm in a minority.

But I won't sugar coat this either, pun so intended. Amelie's has some great sandwich and bread choices. I like to say that anything on a croissant can't disappoint. I tend to go for the teas because I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't attest to its quality. As for the sweets, I've not always been so happy with them. Some of the more outrageous ones with lots of extras attached are overdoing it in my opinion. And the expensive colorful truffles are not worth it. I guess that's why the case seems to always be full of them. Go for the breads or sandwiches and get the white tea. The atmosphere and layout along with all the kitschy vintage furniture that looks like it could've come out of anywhere from your grandma's storage shed to Rococo era France is great for mood setting. Then there's the courtyard in the back with all the trees and the skylights.

But every once in a while, you hit the jackpot. You walk into a place and as soon as you do, you think to yourself, there is some awesome shit going on here. And y'know? That gut instinct was right. First off - the decour in this place is a-mazing. Extremely eclectic, while being chic, hilarious, hipster and interesting at the same time. I don't know how many times I pointed at things that I just wanted to up and take home with me. STAFF: No complaints on my end, but I'm a pretty easy person to please. However, one person I was with was miffed to learn that they only used whole milk or soy to make lattes, no skim or inbetweensies. Another friend I was with is very specific in what she gets - coffee, iced, half cream/half 2%. Not only did they not have 2%, but using cream was 'against the rules', which I'm not even sure the meaning of on that one. I had no problems, though. FOOD: Breakfast sandwiches are absolutely incredible. Sausage, egg, tomato, gruyer on a croissant. Not to mention it's huge. It was all flaky, warm and delicious. Other breakfast sandwich experiences were the same from people in my party - all to die for. Picked up a couple of tarts, as well. The raspberry lemon tart is not only gorgeous, but absolutely delicious. Picked up another tart that was chocolate ganache with raspberry preserves, but it was a little too sweet for my taste. I got to sample the lemon tea cake as well, and though a little pricy, I would definitely pick up some for a tea party (being a huge tea aficionado in the first place). Coupled with the free wifi, and comfortable and plentiful seating, I'm definitely on the Amelie bandwagon.

That said, I'm still giving this place 5-stars and here's why: They have 12 flavors of ice cream, all home made in small batches by a chef with 30 years experience. Two brothers own and run the shop and are very personable. Living in Phoenix, I'm accustomed to dealing with store employees who act like robots and would rather be doing something else. I was confused when everyone that works here was so out-going and friendly. Was I still in Phoenix? I like it! You can have cereal toppings on your home made ice cream, or you can have your ice cream inside of a donut! There are also cones and cups for your ice cream, as well as fresh waffles to sandwich the ice cream in-between! To be honest, I thought the neighborhood was shady, but that's just my old-age attitude. Once you find a place to park down the street, everyone is courteous and friendly. It draws the right crowd. There are several businesses all tucked in behind ThirdSpace (the business you will see from Grand Ave.) It's a very unique layout, with a tattoo shop, a bicycle shop, a smoke shop, a barbershop and Novel ice cream. Across the street is Grand Avenue Pizza and many places around here are open until 4am!!! The ice cream and toppings are fresh and delicious. A pair of brothers own and operate the place. This is what America is supposed to be about. People loving what they do, following their passion and their dreams. How can you NOT support a business like this? Before Ben & Jerry sold out to a major corporation, they used to be a small, family-owned business. I find more value and appreciation from small businesses than ANY corporations.

Like a vintage candy store and ice cream parlor equipped with nostalgic candy and toys, ice cream, and other delicious-looking confections. The whimsical designs and fonts made it welcoming. The shop is much smaller than I imagined and even more so when it's busy. The line moved quickly, but you barely have time to put your wallet away before they're ringing up the next customer. Then you have to figure out where to eat your ice cream as it's quickly melting. There aren't any tables and barely any room to stand in the shop. I believe there are tables in the back, but I wasn't looking to venture in that particularly hot afternoon. There were ten flavors available (Dulce Le Leche, Double Chocolate, Chocolate Sorbet, Strawberry, Toasted Coconut, Vietnamese Coffee, Butter Pecan, Chocolate Mint, Hangover Helper, and Sweet Cream), but unfortunately none of the flavors I wanted to try. It did make my decision very easy as I chose a scoop of Toasted Coconut on a waffle cone. Ruben went with Double Chocolate on a pretzel cone. The ice creams were creamy and flavorful. I really liked the vast amount of toasted coconut flakes in my ice cream. The cones were also delicious. I was very intrigued by the Fruit Loopy Treats and other cookies available for ice cream sandwiches. I had to take one of the large Coconut Macaroon cookies with me -- I didn't end up enjoying the cookie, which was rather disappointing. Service was pleasant. Everything made for a relatively enjoyable experience, but nothing stood out as amazing. I can't say it was the best ice cream I've ever had, although, I may have felt differently had there been more exciting flavors available like their Whiskey Toffee Almond, Lemon Buttermilk Sherbet, or Coconut Latte. I also think my experience could have been improved had they spent more than five minutes with me. I had no idea you could have toasted fluff on top of your ice cream! My bad for not monopolizing more of their time. FYI: Sugar cones and cake cones are free with your ice cream, waffle cones are an additional 50 cents, and pretzel cones are an additional $1.

I tried the lime basil sherbet and it was so refreshing! The coconut sherbet was also very good. But, ultimately, I'm faithful to chocolate mint so that's what I got. The girl behind the counter asked if I had tried their chocolate chip mint ice cream before because it was ""different"" than your usual minty ice cream. I said I had never been there before so she offered a sample and WOW, she was right but right in a very positive way! This is the best ice cream I've ever had- HANDS DOWN!

I was drawn to this place after learning about their unique artisan ice cream flavors: Blue Cheese Honey, Sweet Corn, Real Mint, Maple Pecan ... plus housemade marshmallows - YUM! I was finally able to convince my hubby to make the pilgrimage because they are (incredibly) open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes it the perfect late night date spot :) The shop is supercute, decor is contemporary and cheerful, with unique lighting fixtures. The tables are lined up along a banquette on the side of the restaurant - again, very date friendly! You can cozy up with your significant other while savoring some yummy icecreamy goodness. They have a stack of board games at the back of the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch as well - how fun to get some delicious icecream while playing Connect Four with a friend? The menu is excellent: from the icecreams themselves to the sundae options and awesome toppings, you really can't go wrong. I went in expecting to order the Campfire S'More Sundae, but made a rogue move at the last moment and switched over to the Pecan Turtle Sundae in a waffle cup... omgoodness, so, so GREAT. Before settling on my sundae, I did get a quick sample of the Plum Verbena icecream and wow - light, refreshing, and unique - definitely a good pick if you're in the mood for a scoop or two. Now, back to the Pecan Turtle Sundae: I've had lots of Turtle Sundaes and this one was just head and shoulders above anything else I've ever tasted. I seriously dreamed about it from the time I left Sweet Republic until the following weekend, when we returned so that I could have it again (and share it with my Grandmother, who is a fellow appreciator of a good frozen treat!) The sundae is topped with hot fudge and salted caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream, and pecans that are toasted/transformed into little nuggets of greatness. The waffle bowl was the crowning glory: sweet, crispy, crunchy and delicious - be sure to get one :) My husband ordered the Cookie Mintifesto and he loved it, although I wasn't a huge fan of the ""real"" mint - I prefer fake mint, I guess :) It was pretty ""brisk"" and not very sweet. My son tried the Honey Blue Cheese on our second visit and was smacking his lips and ""mmm-mmm""ing the whole time. Service was alright - the sundaes take a bit of time to make and when they're busy, the employees seem stressed.

It's wonderful. It's the saving grace of Charlotte for me, and it's what tips the scales and makes me actually want to hang out here on a regular basis. I'm serious - and not even because of the pastries and shizz. Basically you have a place that has excellent coffee products (not cheap tho) and tasty pastries (a little overpriced for Charlotte, more like NYC prices, but a very good standard) with free Wi-Fi and a decent amount of outlets, and fairly comfortable rooms (lots and lots of rooms, all of them interesting and intimate and full of cuties at any old time of day), and plenty of space and tons of sexy people coming in at night - and I mean tons... don't get me started on the sexy people in the daytime, and not just my Barbie. And this place is open 24 hours a day and they have no problem with me hanging out here for six or seven hours and doing all of my Yelp stuffs online, although I did spend a decent amount of money here too, but I don't think they would have cared even if I hadn't. They have gender-neutral restrooms and a generally liberal attitude, and it's just a wonderful place with a great French theme, and there are several of them now, including the 6th or 7th location which is the first outside CLT, and of course it's in CLT's role model... Atlanta. The one in the downtown is really nice too, but this will always be my favourite because it is 24 hours and it rocks. There's just one major problem and it was pretty major for me, which was that after staying here all night I was like an icicle. I was totally frozen. The temperature wasn't too awful at 2 or 3 in the morning but once it got to six and seven and eight I was shivering profusely from the cold. I went to the car shaking like a leaf at 8:15 a.m. and continue to shake, and needed some heatblasting action. But they have pretty decent key lime Tarts and really good mixed berry tarts, and that salted coffee drink that the one dude gave me which is one of the lattes I think - the bottom one on the list, and the one that he recommended over my initial choice - was spectacular and I would order it again and again and again, and will do. So thank you for the wonderful guy who I think was possibly hitting on me, for being a real angel and making me get this expensive drink, because it was the highlight of my stay here and it helped me get all my sh** done more or less. In other words all the Yelp reviews written before the pictures expired. I'll be back here again pretty soon, which is funny because I first came here when on tour for my music a decade ago, and slept out front without ever going in. I'm glad I finally rectumfied that. And as I've said, it's not difficult to gain weight from these products. In fact I do it with great Amel-ease. This review is true, or my name's not SAM LEE And my shaved body and tan aren't MANLY They're full of French pastries and they treat you like FAMILY And everything is cheap, or my name's not STANLEY I used to live in LA, in the San Fernando VALLEY My creepy room-mates used to call me sleazy SALLY I wanted to find a good bakery very BADLY But there was nothing French and really yummy, SADLY Then I was way down in a town called MIAMI Where the girls are so hot, so I would return, GLADLY But I asked for French baked goods, and they refused FLATLY And yelled at me in a way not unlike Gordon RAMSEY So I drove up to Carolina using Rand MCNALLY And the resemblance of this bakery to France is UNCANNY If I keep getting naked in their lobby they might BAN ME But I hope not because I love the pastries at AMELIE'S WHAT!",am%C3%A9lies-french-bakery-and-caf%C3%A9-charlotte-11

The textures play with each other nicely. You have the crunch of the cone and toffee, the smoothness of the banana, and a nice sweet kick from the caramel. I must say that I actually enjoyed the Camp Fire Smores a little better. If you close your eyes, you can actually smell the campfire. I don't know how they add that smokiness, but Alton Brown really needs to try this one as well. Eventually we snagged a table and were able to relax and enjoy these magical creations.

It is vanilla ice cream with two warm sticky buns and maple syrup on top. Their chocolate chip cookie sundae is also very good. An underrated part of Page's is their food. They have one of the best cheesesteaks you will find it Pittsburgh. Their burgers are also great.",pages-pittsburgh

However, do NOT buy the cake if you are actually looking for a delicious cake. I ordered the strawberry cream cake which sounds and looks amazing - truly a piece of art, but it's surely not meant to actually be eaten. It's 90% fondant / stiff pastry cream stuff, with zero taste but LOTS of fat. Little channels were dug out and the smallest amount of cake possible was inserted. On top, another stiff greasy fondant pile /swirl topped it off. The ONLY thing strawberry about this 'cake' was a single strawberry, dipped in some glossy gelatinous substance, placed on top, way out of reach of the cake. And it was ~$6.",am%C3%A9lies-french-bakery-and-caf%C3%A9-charlotte-11

I must say, we were underwhelmed, to say the least. Of the five employees working, we noted not a single smile. At best, they seemed bored and uninterested. That was disappointing. Then, there was the food. We ordered a brownie, red velvet cupcake and a cannoli. They didn't even have regular cannoli, so we got a chocolate chip cannoli. Not a single dessert impressed. They were all just average. We bought cupcakes from the grocery store bakery a few days later that we all agreed were better. Sad, sad experience.

I've tried a variety of their donuts: creme brÃ»lÃ©e, bacon cinnamon roll, strawberry cream, French toast and more. French toast donuts are only available on weekends and those are must-haves!

I swear they asked for every shirt in every size! There should definitely be a pastry line and a different line for merch. Once we ordered we got: Lobster tail Cream puff Canoli Eclair Pecan cookie Everything was good, minus the canolis...I know right?!? Very disappointed. Not what I expected at all.

I came to Charlotte for work and I told by everyone that this was likely the best bakery in Charlotte, with some of the best coffee. I have got to say that Amelies is a good bakery and it's definitely worth a visit. However, I can certainly attest to having better coffee at 7th Street Market and know at least 2 bakeries in Durham, NC that have better pastries and bread by a LONG shot.

Mitchell's ice cream is a gem of a shop. All the ice cream is home made and this particular Mitchell's has the little factory on the inside that you can see through the glass behind the counter. The store is huge. The lines are always wrapping out the door, that's how popular this place is. I've tried a few things from Mitchell's, my favorite has to be the mint dark chocolate chunk ice cream. What I like about it is that there are nice big chunks of dark chocolate in the ice cream AND the ice cream isn't dyed green. It's plenty minty without being overbearing. I usually like to get the ice cream in a sundae with hot fudge and extra whipped cream. I love their whipped cream and would totally buy a canister of it and eat it in one sitting.

I got breakfast here a few days: pain au choclat one day, an ""epi loaf"" (mini baguette) with butter and preserves another day. Both were incredible. The pain au chocolat was super flaky and had a very respectable amount of chocolate inside. The epi loaf was just plain good bread, but the preserves were unexpectedly delicious: blackberry jam, just bursting with flavor. I picked up the large box of macarons on my way home, which comes with a flavor assortment (raspberry, pistachio, salted caramel, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate). Laduree is still my favorite (airier, more delicate) but these were pretty darn good. I'm not sure they were as fresh as they could have been, they had a date sticker on them that was two days old. I think that may have been when they were baked? I was in a rush so I didn't notice until I was in the cab. Regardless, they were pretty great macarons.

I asked server what she suggested and she said the watermelon sorbet. It was good, but a little too sweet. So I tried about three more including the sweet corn which was okay. I don't remember the others I of course ended up buying one that I didn't even sample. I ended up with the Basil Lime Sorbet. It was good if you like sour things.

Needless to say, I polished off both cups of custard each time. Supposedly 90% fat free, but I don't believe something that good could ever be fat free.
