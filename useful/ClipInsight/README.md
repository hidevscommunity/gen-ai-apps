## About The Project

https://github.com/Sahil-kachhap/ClipInsight/assets/54017876/4b1421df-61bf-42e6-abdf-e7fdf97d4f99

**ClipInsight** is the result of a creative whirlwind during **LLM Hackathon by Streamlit** and **Generative AI hackathon by Peerlist**, where we set out to tackle the frustration of navigating through lengthy video content on platforms like YouTube. Our mission was to make video content more accessible, interactive, and time-efficient for users from all walks of life.

**Why?** Because we believe that knowledge should be easily accessible and engaging for everyone.

## Key Features

- ðŸ“‹ **Text-Based Summaries with Timestamps**: Our app analyzes videos and generates concise summaries of key moments, complete with timestamps. No more endless scrolling!

- ðŸ’¬ **Real-Time Chat**: Engage in dynamic discussions while interacting with our AI assistant. Ask questions and share insights.

## WellTestedAI OctoberFest 
I have added 2 unit tests described below :-
1. **download_video_test.py** - this unit test tests the download_video() method which actually extracts audio from a youtube video url.
2. **split_transcript_test.py** - this unit test tests the split_transcript() method which is a utility method in itself and helps in breaking a huge file of text into several chunks.

- To Run the test file: `python -m unittest <file_name>.py`
