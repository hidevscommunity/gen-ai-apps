## Overview

This Streamlit application allows you to easily convert YouTube video or any Audio/Video(.mp3, .mp4 or .wav) content into PDF/txt documents or get a summary. It leverages the AssemblyAI API for audio transcription and summarization.
Deciding whether to watch a full video can be a time-consuming task. To address this concern, I'm have introduce a summary feature in my app. With this feature, users will receive a concise summary of the video's content before deciding to watch it. This way, they can make more informed choices about the videos they invest their time in, improving the overall user experience and ensuring they get the content they're interested in.

I built my app to address the challenge of efficiently transcribing YouTube video or any Audio/Video (.mp3, .mp4 or .wav) content into text format. Many content creators, researchers, and businesses require accurate transcriptions for various purposes, but manual transcription can be time-consuming and costly. My app solves this problem by automating the transcription process through AssemblyAI, providing users with a cost-effective and convenient way to obtain accurate transcriptions, ultimately saving time and resources
