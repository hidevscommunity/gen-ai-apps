[{"text": "The Joe Rogan Experience. I don't want every one of my sentences to sound like Barry White. Is that what it sounds like in your ears? In headphones, they do. It's like, oh, hey, baby. I just can't. Whereas without the headphones, I'm just regular. All right. Ready? All ready. Good to see you. Hey. What's happening? Joe. I'm excited to talk to you. I'm excited to talk to you about a bunch of things, but I've been paying attention to all the web telescope. Oh my gosh. Fascinating. It's all that. Could you please explain the difference in the ability of the capabilities of this telescope versus what we've had previously? Yeah, so first of all, it's all that. And the excitement was in part because so much could have gone wrong with this thing. And the fact that nothing went wrong, we were ecstatic. Could you explain how complicated it is to get something like that? So one of the great challenges that we face is, how do you put a telescope in orbit that's bigger than the rocket that's going to launch it? Is that even possible? And the Hubble telescope, do you know what set the size of that? 94-inch diameter mirror. That's the biggest mirror you could fit in the payload of the space shuttle. That's what set the size of that telescope. Big as it was, we would have made it bigger if the space shuttle were bigger. Now, I don't know if you've seen the Hubble telescope. There's a replica of it at the Air and Space Museum. Let's take a photo of it. And it's there hanging from the ceiling. But if you want to know how, it's about the size of a Greyhound bus. So the space shuttle deployed a Greyhound bus into orbit, which is the Hubble Space Telescope. And the value of the Hubble was that you could update it with servicing missions, and it was serviced many times. And as a result, it lived within our culture for three decades. There are people who came of age only ever knowing the majesty of the universe as delivered to you by the Hubble Telescope. 30 years worth of this, think about it. Most other telescopes, they put into orbit and they have a five year mission and then they come down. So they don't have a chance to get inside you, to become something that you, oh, you got a nice visual there. So that's the Hubble Telescope on the left, which every year, every year I post a tweet  at the end of the Stanley Cup, and I say, the Stanley Cup and the Hubble Telescope had the same designer. Really? No, I'm just kidding. No, just look at the thing. Oh. It looks like the Stanley Cup. A little bit. A lot. I wouldn't confuse the two if they were in a room together. So here's the thing. So notice the Hubble telescope, its diameter is the spherical shape that fits in the spherical payload of the space shuttle. So now we want to put a bigger telescope into orbit. How do you do that? And so this is where you need engineers, clever engineers. We say, here's a rocket, one of the most powerful rockets we can use, but the fairing, that's the place where you hold the payload, can only be so big. And they say, all right, why don't we fold the telescope? Now, how are you going to fold the mirror? Turn the mirror into segments, hexagons. Hexagons, one of only three shapes that can tile a surface, a square, a triangle, and a hexagon. No other shape can do this. Well, you can have other irregular shapes that can match up. You can tessellate, what it's called. But if you have what's called a regular polygon, so here in the image there, what you can see is all of the mirror segments. Those fold. Into a narrow structure along with the the unfurling Solar panels as well as the heat shield notice has made it Northrop Grumman by the way Grumman has a long history in Helping NASA put stuff in space the LEM lunar excursion module remember that the thing that landed on the moon is  That was designed and built in Bethpage, Long Island at Grumman Aerospace. And so this is, and you go to Bethpage today, people still stand tall, because they had aunts and uncles who worked on that project. Space is a force of nature unto itself, in our sense of pride, in our sense of achievement, in our sense of what,  Operates on civilization to take us into the future lest we continue to regress and move back into the cave which we came there it is all folded up in the image we now see for those who are watching this and you slip that into a fairing and then you launch it a million miles from Earth and  opposite the sun from Earth, and it unfurls like petals of a flower. Is there an animation of how that goes down? Oh, yeah. Yeah, slow-mo animation. Sure, he can find it. And it's the deployment, how it deployed as it was on its way to its location, which is one of the Lagrangian points in orbit. For every two objects that orbit each other, there are five Lagrangian points. So here we are unfolding. So there we have solar panels coming out the side. And there's the communication antenna. And it has a unique set of baffles that shield it from sunlight. So that the mirror and the detector can be very, very cold. because it's designed, it's specially tuned to observe infrared that comes to us from space. And infrared, as you may know, we normally associate it with heat. Well, how am I gonna detect something that's very, very cold in space if my detector is hotter than what I'm trying to detect? You can't, there's no way to see something that is warmer  than the temperature of your detector. So your detector has to be very cold, extremely cold. So these are the baffles, and there are many, many layers. So that when sunlight hits one layer,  That layer absorbs it and re-radiates it in both directions, forward and back. So there's less that goes to the next layer. So then the next layer re-radiates it and by the time it gets to the fourth layer, hardly anything goes towards the telescope. And so it is insulated and it drops to deep space cold temperatures. And it's literally where the sun don't shine right now. So the solar panels are getting the solar energy from the bottom. Yeah, because that's the direction the sun is, correct. So it radiates off the bottom, and those are the things that protect it. And you see how all those layers fan out. All the layers, yeah. Amazing. Yeah. And it's specifically tuned for the infrared part of the spectrum. You remember the spectrum. So you have visible light, right? ROYGBIV, if you want to remember it. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Parts of the spectrum we can see but there's light outside of this. There's like beyond the violet. There's ultraviolet That's way how you get that and below the red is infrared Not visible to the human eye by the way insects can see ultraviolet. We can't that's my bug zappers work You put a UV light in a bug zapper The bugs say, oh my gosh, I love ultraviolet. And then they get zapped. And we're old enough to remember before there were bug zappers, you'd had a picnic bulb for twilight picnics. And it's like a yellow bulb, kind of yellow amber bulb. It was a bug bulb. It was sold as bug bulbs. It's not that they repelled bugs. It's that the bugs couldn't even see it. because their whole vision is shifted towards the ultraviolet. And it leaves out the deep red. So that's evidence we're smarter than bugs. That's one piece of evidence that we're smarter than bugs. So just to bring that to a closure, the earliest forming galaxies in the universe radiated a lot of ultraviolet. So you might say, well, let's get an ultraviolet telescope. No, because 14 billion years later, the expansion of the universe has redshifted the ultraviolet into the infrared. So if you want to see the birth of galaxies, you've got to know what they look like in the here and the now. And in the here and the now, it's in the infrared. So this is a telescope specifically tuned to see galaxies born at the edge of the universe, and infrared also allows you to see deep into gas clouds. Now when they're showing you an image like this. So right here, this is the Pillars of Creation, which were so named at the time Hubble first attempted this. We were gaga over the Hubble image of this. And now like the JWST, oh my gosh. For those who are more prone to religion, some have called this the hand of God. Because if you look at the pillars, you can kind of picture like a thumb and fingers, yeah. But regardless, this is nearby. This is the telescope peering deep into gas clouds that otherwise would enshroud what's going on. And you get to see stars being born, planets being born. And so what's remarkable about JWST is that to be tuned for the edge of the universe,  and the birth of galaxies is the same properties you would want to see the birth of stars. A star is born right in front of your nose that would otherwise be cloaked by gas. And infrared penetrates those clouds and enables you to see it as though the cloud isn't even there. And you already know this because if you're driving through fog, okay, you put on your fog lights. The fog lights are not blue. They're like reddish, amber, okay? That improves your ability to see through the fog. If we could see infrared, that's the kind of light you'd use, then you wouldn't even know the fog was there. That's why self-driving cars will be amazing. It won't matter if it's foggy. They'll be able to see everything. Just give them infrared sensors. The fog is irrelevant. They can drive 100 miles an hour in dense fog, and all the cars will see each other. and they wanna change lanes, they tell other cars, I'm gonna change lanes, they'll part for them, open up, and we won't get 40,000 deaths a year as we currently do from automobile accidents. Now, how much bigger is this telescope? So, you wanna think about collecting area, and I forgot the exact number, something like eight times around there, more powerful in the sense of, it can see things eight times dimmer, Yeah, that there you go, so that's two is about two and a half squared It's about eight times the area and the technology obviously is improved as well So like the ability that well our detectors are better and let me remind you that when the Hubble was designed It was designed in like the 1980s and it was scheduled to go up and then we had the Challenger accident and And that delayed the shuttle program. So there's Hubble sitting there in mothballs with an old Microsoft chip. And by the time it launched, it was already not as fast as it could have been. And so the very first servicing mission swapped all that out and put in better methods and tools for measuring what it is we always needed it to do. So one sad part about this  is that it's not serviceable. We have no access to that point in space a million miles from the moon. We haven't left low Earth orbit since 1972. We're not going out a million miles from Earth to fix a telescope. So that's unfortunate. Maybe a robotic fix, I don't know, to refill some of the fuel. It needs fuel to station keep. Didn't it get hit by a micrometeor? Yeah, well, that's the brakes when you're in space. Yeah. Yeah, but it doesn't affect the overall performance. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's huge and micrometeorites will do small damage, but you don't want in the middle of a meteor storm. That would be totally bad. And do they, I mean, they obviously know like where some of the asteroid belts are and where some of the nearby earth objects are. Yeah. So in this context, so first most asteroids are in the asteroid belt. So that's between Mars and Jupiter, so I have an asteroid named after me and I don't mean to brag or anything Can you like get a star named after you online not leave not not authentically With your name drawn in the map see pay for a piece of paper Yeah, they claim that it goes gets registered with the astrophysicist, but it doesn't  There's only one way we name stars, and that's by committee and by traditions and this sort of thing. They're fascinating traditions. So planets are named after Roman gods, and planet moons are named after Greek characters in the life of the Greek god who's the counterpart to that Roman god. So Jupiter, for example, one of its moons is Ganymede. Ganymede was the manservant of Zeus, and Zeus and Jupiter were corresponding gods in Greek and Roman. And not only that, what's the number, is it about half, somewhere around there, of all the stars in the night sky that have names, have Arabic names. So in my field, we have deep respect for people who made great inroads into understanding the natural universe. And the golden age of Islam from a thousand years ago made material contributions in this regard. And of course, Greek and Roman legends and this sort of thing. So there they are in its influence on Western culture. So, yeah, no, the universe is a fun place. Pretty fun place. Oh, yeah. So, this James Webb Telescope, in terms of its ability to recognize things, like, what magnitude of improvement are we talking about from the Hubble? Yeah, a factor of 10. A factor of 10. Yeah, easily. That's right. Well, a factor of 10 for the things Hubble could see, but it's incalculable when it sees things that Hubble could have never seen, because Hubble was not tuned for the infrared. So then you can't even compare it. It's a complete other window opened up to the universe for you. So what has changed in terms of our understanding? The web has been in the million mile orbit or however far away it is for how long now? Well, it got there and then we did some engineering. So I guess a year year and a half Yeah, and what has changed in our understanding? So that's that's been people's first question. And what I want to do is temper that To say something a little different. So Yes, we expect James Webb to make great discoveries. We expect that but the first order of business is  is hardly ever, let's discover something new today. It's, here's something that we have limited understanding of, let's improve on that. And in so doing, we deepen our understanding of how things work in the universe. That doesn't always involve overturning a previous idea or discovering something that nobody ordered, all right? That will happen, we fully expect that to happen, but we targeted parts of the sky initially because we know other telescopes have gone there before. And we're gonna say, how can we further advance and deepen our understanding? One thing it's gonna be able to do, and it has already done,  We have, you know how many exoplanets there are? I don't know how many of your audience was born after 1995. How many 27 year olds and younger? Probably quite a few. Quite a few, okay. So I will take this opportunity to knight them. Generation exoplanet. 1995 I was the first exoplanet discovered a planet orbiting another star and I'll never forget that because it was my first time on national television I was freshly minted as director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City and NBC Center New York City is the media news headquarters right of all the networks so NBC sent an action cam they interviewed me because of my title not because they knew or gave it  crap, who I was, my title was Director of the Planetarium. And so, I gave my best professorial reply. I said, well, the Doppler shift, this is how it's discovered and what we do and how we measure it. And I was describing the fact that when you discover these planets, you don't actually see the planet. You see the effect of the planet's gravity on the host star. And so, if you'd watch the host star, the host star jiggles. Okay, just a little bit in response to the planet going back and forth around it. So you're measuring the star. So I motioned that with my hips and that evening on the evening news, that's all they showed was me jiggling my hips. I said, oh my God. Okay, that's how you're gonna do this. Okay. You don't want me to be Professor Neil. You want me to be Soundbite Neil. All right, so from then on, I practiced my soundbites. And a soundbite's like three sentences. Oh, so you recognize that this is the format now. Correct. And I said, I can't just give them my stump speech as professor of astrophysics. It has to work in their medium. And so I went home and stood in front of the mirror. And had people just shout out things to me, anything in the universe, any idea, object, person, place, or thing. And I would come up with like three sentences that are interesting, make you smile, and be tasty enough to want to tell someone else the anatomy of a sound bite. So try it. Say anything in the whole universe. How do we know how? No, just one word. Just say anything. The Big Bang. Big Bang. The birth of space-time energy and everything we know and love about this universe occurred 14 billion years ago and we have no idea what happened before it and we're still expanding as we will forever. I read an article... That's my soundbite for the Big Bang. That's a good soundbite. Yeah. I read an article about the Webb telescope, and what they were taking into consideration is the possibility that the Big Bang may be incorrect, and that the universe might be larger and older than we think. So, I hesitate to ask what pages on the internet you hang out on. It wasn't saying the universe is older. It's saying as more data and new information comes in, there is a distinct possibility that the Big Bang might just be the, it just might explain the reach of the technology and not the actual scale of the universe itself. Okay, so the way to think about this is, And this is the way science has worked since basically the year 1600, where Galileo sort of starts codifying what people knew probably should be happening, but no one really did it in large scale. If you have an idea about something, then you test it multiple ways and get other people to test it. And if the tests give you consistent results, you have a new understanding of the universe. When that happens, that,  knowledge of the universe doesn't go away. It doesn't get undone. What happens, typically, is you have a deeper understanding of the universe in which that understanding gets embedded. And you realize that you only understood a small part of a larger whole. But the small parts you did understand, where you had multiple experiments that confirmed it, that doesn't change. So the cleanest example of this, and I'll get back to your question, is Newton's laws of motion and gravity. He, you know, did anyone see anything move faster than a galloping horse in his day? Probably not. And so the Newton's laws of motion and gravity worked. They worked not only for galloping horses, it worked for the moon in orbit around the earth and the earth in orbit around the sun and Jupiter's moons in orbit around Jupiter. All right, and for the planets. So, okay, but wait a minute. It doesn't work for Mercury. Mercury's orbit is not following Newton's laws. Is there something wrong with the data? Let's check it. Data's correct. Oh my gosh, what's happening? Einstein comes along and says, I have a new understanding of gravity and a new understanding of motion. And it accounts for this weirdness in Mercury's orbit. What was the weirdness? Its shape was not exactly what Newton's laws of gravity would give you. its shape could only be accounted for when you throw in Einstein's theory of general relativity. Why? Because the sun's gravity is so monstrous and Mercury's orbiting close enough to it that it's being influenced by extra phenomenon going on in the universe that's the product of very high and significant gravity. And so, so then do we throw Newton out the window? No, actually. You know what Newton's laws are? They're what Einstein's laws look like when you put in low speeds and low gravity. They become Newton's laws in that limit. Newton's laws don't stop working where they used to work. Apollo to the moon used only Newton's laws. Because Einstein didn't matter at those scales, the moon and earth and rockets. We're not going fast enough for any of that to matter. But when you start going fast enough, you cannot use Newton's laws. You have to use a deeper understanding. Now, where does Einstein take us? You go into the center of a black hole, you get black holes from Einstein. Center of a black hole, there's a singularity. All the theories say the matter occupies zero volume. Thereby having infinite density and that's kind of weird what no you can't have infinite no That's a limit of Einstein's theory. That's where it breaks down. It's some joke. That's where God divides by zero remember in math class You can't divide by zero. It's not not defined or not allowed. So in Einstein's equations We're dividing by zero at the singularity. So we all know that  that as brilliant as Einstein was, and as successful as his general theory of relativity has been, it has limits. And one limit is the center of a black hole, and another limit is the very birth of the universe itself. Getting back to your question, the Big Bang. So, we have top people working on trying to resolve the singularity problem. And in so doing, you get to some ideas that, well, maybe our Big Bang, because the Big Bang's not gonna go away. All the data support this. So now I've got this Big Bang thing, okay? And well, is this embedded in something bigger? Ooh. So when you put like quantum physics and general relativity and you try to come up with some bigger understanding, deeper understanding, strength theorists have been all into this. you get a multiverse. We didn't pull that out of our ass, that came out of the equations. So, how old is the multiverse? I don't know. It's definitely older than our universe, because it birthed our universe, and it births other universes, and it births, the way the equations drive it, an infinity of universes. This is the idea that maybe there's a version of us in another where I'm bald and you got the afro and who is, but everything else is the same. And also a version where everything's the same. Where everything would be the same, yes. Everything you've ever said has been said before exactly in the same order. Correct. There's no reason to presume that everything in this universe isn't or hasn't already played out. in the exact way in another one of these infinite universes. And in an infinite number of different ways. Correct. And so that is what comes out of the equations. So that makes the Big Bang a kind of a small part of a much larger whole. And so, yeah, we're ready for that. But the fact that the universe had a beginning 14 billion years ago, and there's the cosmic microwave background, all of these features  Intact they're not gonna all of a sudden not apply. That's my point. That's my long answer to you So this thing that happened 14 billion years ago. What is the predominant theory of why? So this multiverse concept Gives us a reason why? okay, so I'm  It's like, imagine you're rolling around in a basin, okay? And you're stable there, you're just fine, but then something kicks you out of the basin and you didn't know that there's a huge hill to roll down after you come out of that basin. But you didn't know that, you thought everything was just fine. You roll down that hill, you're gaining energy. At the bottom of the hill, something stops you. And then where does all that energy go? One of the hypotheses, and I'm highly simplifying here, is that the energy gained by rolling down a hill, and these are energy hills that would exist in this sort of higher dimensional space that we're talking about. That energy has to manifest in that object somehow, and it becomes an explosion. With enough energy, it gives birth to matter, everything that we know and love, and it expands. Because when you concentrate that much energy in a small spot, that's the only thing you can do. Understand you're simplifying it, but I don't understand in the sense that By using this basin analogy and rolling down a hill that their their equations of the energetics of a system and this is called this is called a Well a false vacuum so you can be in a place that's not the true bottom energy state of the system but you think everything is fine and but it's not and so  If you move around among these hills and valleys, you end up birthing universes out the other side. And this multiverse concept  actually delivers this for you, basically for free. So that thought would be that the Big Bang is just one of many events that happen in the multiverse. Correct. And not only that, it could be that other Big Bang events might have a different, slightly different laws of physics in it. So you want to watch out for that if you cross over from one universe to the other. The charge on the electron is slightly different. You could like all your atoms could just scatter scatter or Compress compress into a pile of goo. Yeah, so take a take something to test first. Yeah, send a chicken out Chickens get no respect  What have happened to guinea pigs? Well, guinea pigs are cute. They have fur. They're cute and furry. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Chickens are way easier to just send to space. I spent a whole section in this book talking about people who love animals and want to care for them and don't want to eat them, but they only love ones that are cuddly. Oh, yeah, for sure. You'd make a plush toy out of it. My agent said that. She knows I hunt. She's like, you should hunt pigs because they're ugly. I'm like, how dare you? First of all, domesticated pigs are adorable. They are. Yeah. Domesticated dogs are ugly, too, because they're desperate. In fact, I have a voice cameo of a pig. in a Disney XD cartoon called Gravity Falls. It's a farmhouse and there's a pig that lives with everybody. And the pig eats some slop that the kids are told makes you smarter. And so they bought it at a fair or something. So they went to sleep putting the slop on their forehead. thinking it would get into their head and make them smart. But the pig sees it on their forehead and licks it off of their forehead. And then overnight, the pig becomes a supreme genius, builds an atom smasher, builds a voice translator. And while the pig is smart, I'm its voice. It's cute. It's a cute. And so but what was I talking about before big bang? multiverses different laws of physics Slightly different laws of physics are a fascinating prospect how that they might vary and how you might want to avoid it Oh what I was talking about you want to save animals? I've never seen I've never seen anyone say save the leeches  No, no one cares about bugs save the ticks in particular parasites save the mosquitoes mosquitoes, you know the biggest enemy of humans as Big an enemy as we are to each other through warfare in the history of civilization the greatest enemy to human life has been the mosquito and  responsible for more than a billion human deaths in the history of civilization and so Here we have mosquitoes ticks tapeworms You know go down the list and you can ask If you really into animals and don't want to kill them if you heard that ticks were endangered Would you start a movement to protect ticks? Would you do that? If you would have more power to you, but I'm thinking you're not why would you if you know about Lyme disease? This is my point. Yeah, or this is my point. I mean, by the way, the Lyme virus wants to live too, right? These are all creatures on God's green earth, right? And so so you end up being a species bigot and  Mmm, that's in the chapter meat Terrians and vegetarians there's the the philosophies that are that each of those camps will embrace and the question is how Thoroughly thought through are those? philosophies like in one example, let's say you don't want to kill animals and but you So you you have a humane mousetrap in your basement Okay, why not? You don't want to snap the neck of the mouse. That's cruel. And you like animals, right? So you save the mouse. You got to check on it every few days because they dry out quickly if you trap it. So what do you do when you catch it? What do they do? Release it back into the wild. Guaranteeing the mouse gets eaten whole by an owl or pecked apart by all manner of woodland predators between 9 and 18 months of its life. So the safest thing to do with your mouse is to leave it in your basement. If you really care about animal life and the mouse managed to get into your basement, leave it there. It'll live up to six years in your basement. I lived in Colorado for a while next to an ashram and I was visiting the ashram and talking to the woman who runs it and she sprayed raid all over these ants. And I go, what are you doing? And she's like, well, it's unfortunate, but, you know, we have to address the fact that we have an infestation of insects. I'm like, you just mass killed all these living beings with poison from the sky. And you did it in front of me. Aerial assault. While you're espousing the benefits of Buddhism and meditation and... Yeah, so people kind of cherry pick. Yeah. And I understand it, but... It's odd. I don't mind if someone cherry picks as long as they're completely self-aware. Most people aren't. And by the way, the home where you're saving the mouse,  I did a rough calculation. It's probably made from the wood of about 50 trees. Each tree could have lived 100 years, but didn't, because it was cut down to make your home. The studs, the two by fours, the floorboards, the wall panels, the siding. And each of those trees was home to birds and insects and fungus and squirrels. And every day of that tree's life, via photosynthesis, it created 15 times the mass of the mouse in breathable oxygen. So I ask you, who do you think nature cares more about? The tree or your one ounce mouse? Probably the tree. I'm thinking. And some trees live 1,000 years. Well, have you paid attention to some of the new research that's being done about how trees communicate with each other? I'll get to that. Yeah, I'll get to that. That's in that chapter, the vegetarians and vegetarians chapter. So trees are fascinating. I've heard people say, well, the mouse has a beating heart, and the tree does not, or plants do not, and animals do. And I said to my, well, let me think this through. If you cloak a tree, does it not suffocate? If you cut a tree, does it not bleed? If you cut off its nutrients at the base, does it not wither and die? Well, when they're aware they're being eaten, they release plant defense chemicals. I'm getting there. I'm getting there. All I'm saying is the tree gets nutrients from the soil to the topmost leaf. It does it not for want of a beating heart. It does it in spite of not having one. It has a circulation. It just has a different way of life. It's where I get my maple syrup from, tree blood. So to fault a tree or plant life for not having a beating heart, when it's not that they need one and don't have one, it's that they don't need one and never wanted one. Now you're talking about the mycelium. So this is a interconnected network. It's a fungal network underfoot in a forest where it connects multiple kingdoms of life. There are four kingdoms. You might have learned that there were two. We've upped it since then. Those two kingdoms are still intact, but like I said,  Now there's more, it's embedded in a larger truth. There's the plant kingdom, animal kingdom, fungal kingdom, and then we have a kingdom that includes all of the bacteria and archaea and other microscopic life forms. And so, here's an interesting fact. I lost sleep for a week over this, ready? If you look at the common ancestor between fungus and animals,  Because the tree of life ultimately has one taproot. And as it splits, it speciates and you get all these things. The diversity of life on Earth is enabled by the fact that life can speciate. You look at the common ancestor between animals and fungus. The common ancestor between humans and mushrooms split later  than its common ancestor split with green plants. What that means is, we and mushrooms are more alike than either we or mushrooms are to green plants. Well, mushrooms breathe oxygen. All I'm saying is, you grill a portobello mushroom, what's the first word people use to describe it? Vegetarian. No, we talk about mushrooms tasting meaty. Yeah, yeah, meaty, meaty mushroom. No one has, last I checked, no one has ever accused kale of tasting meaty. So in a way, we're kind of biting into ourselves. Plus mushrooms, you know, shrooms, you know, people have whole relationships with mushrooms. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and mushrooms are fungus fungus thrives on our body. Have you ever done psychedelic mushrooms? I've never done anything Psychedelic, okay. I tell you why yeah, please do so. I don't know if it's a good reason  I don't know if it's the best reason that can exist, but for me it's a really good reason. The human mind barely works as it is. Barely. You ever see a book of optical illusions? No one doesn't love a good book of optical illusions and you turn the pale. What is that? Oh, is it in the page out of the page? Is the line longer? Is it shorter? And you'd scratch in your head. These are simple line drawings that confound the human mind's ability to interpret. Our brain barely works as an accurate decoder of the natural world around you. You now want to stir in chemicals. I recognize it'll take you on a ride, but I have always valued objective reality. I don't want anything interfering with my understanding of what is actually happening in front of me. And there are people who would claim that under the influence, they're accessing some actual other reality. All I can say is, if in that other reality you can, you know, invent the James Webb Space Telescope, tell me about it. If you can figure out how to fly, you know, and if you can do that, tell us about it. And there are people who say, oh, I visited Venus when I was on a head trip. Did you bring back evidence? Evidence matters, okay. Did you bring it? No, but it was in their head. Well, the material world, what we're talking about is actual physical objects, right? It's that like if you could bring back the physical universe the physical what they're Experiencing is something akin to you could call it a hallucination. You could call it a portal where Physical reality doesn't exist and you only exist as consciousness. Here's my skepticism I don't mind people saying that they visited another planet. Mm-hmm Or whatever, wherever they're visiting, or some astral plane, okay? I don't, okay. You know, write a travelogue and share it with people, as some have done. I guess I would ask whether what you experienced is part of an objective reality that we can all recognize. Because if it's not, then it's completely in your head. And if it's completely in your head, it's less useful. But what do you mean by that? Part of an objective reality? An objective reality. So here's an example. The when people have these near-death experiences, okay or one where they're dying on a table and they a Commonly described they leave their body and they look back on themselves. Okay, that's a thing going. That's something. Okay, right Let's investigate this. Okay, so the test for whether you really left your body is  or whether you were hallucinating it, is get some writing that faces the ceiling up above your body, okay? And they've done this experiment. And if you're floating above your body, above that piece of paper, when you come back to life, you should be able to say what's written on that piece of paper. That is yet to happen. If you get above it. Yeah, if you get above it. Correct. That is yet to happen. That's a really good piece of paper be suspended. You have to put it up on a shelf or something. Yeah, you'd be able to put it in a way that it would be clearly then the person would have to die knowing that piece of paper was there and then be brought back possibly if Yeah, I mean the you'd have to tell them. Hey, I know you're gonna die. You're gonna die. We're gonna if you come back Yeah, I have a piece of paper up here. That's so free from it a pretty ridiculous experiment No, if you care, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait pause pause from dip  Ridiculous experiment. So like, hey, I know this guy's about to die, but instead of concentrating on bringing him back to life, let's write down on a piece of paper and leave it on the shelf. But who the fuck is going to do that? You know what they did? What? In 1895, after Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovers x-rays, and they find out it penetrates your body, and you can see bones inside your body, you know what they did? What? They set up x-ray machines at the bedside of dying people to see if they can see a soul leave the body. then everybody just got cancer from radiation. They died from cancer? I thought that was an admirable attempt to make a measurement. Yeah, that's interesting. But how would you possibly know that someone is going to die and or have a near-death experience and then put a piece of paper on a shelf? You'd have to be really organized about that. If you want to do this en masse,  You'd have to just like have shelves in every every in every room every are every are correct or yeah How often does that happen where people have? Above their body experiences very frequently reported very frequently. Oh, yeah, I'm just saying that The the brain is capable of so much extraordinary thought within itself of course that  What I care about for the world is what is objectively true and what's objectively true can be verified by multiple people and If it's only true within your head  It's not useful, is all I'm saying. How could it not be useful? To other people. If it's useful to you. And if useful to you. But hold on. If it's useful to you, and then that usefulness to you actually manifests itself in something that gets created because of this experience. Like Kerry Mullis created the PCR method because he had an acid trip. During the acid trip came up with this idea. So I What we'd have to ask is how frequent is that so you get everybody who takes trips of any kind be it mushrooms or acid or and look at the body of their new thoughts that have come from them and  for them having, when they credit it, okay? And Carl Sagan was a big pothead, okay? And highly productive scientist. So the question is, does it give you some insight which, when you were not under the influence, gets you closer to an objective reality? That's an interesting question. Carl Sagan actually believed that there was  The way he described, what was his description, the way he described it? But he said he believed that there are thoughts that were only available when you were under the influence of marijuana. That is certainly the case for any drug, right? Yeah, but he felt like those thoughts were beneficial. Well, I can ask, are those thoughts more connected to reality than if you were not so influenced? I did an experiment with myself, okay? When I first started writing in graduate school, I had a monthly column. I you know there's that stereotype of Hemingway with a drink you know and you do their writing and that's their creative moment I said I don't really like hard liquor but I like wine so so let me get a bottle of wine and drink wine while I write and I say yeah this is good this is good and I'm doing it and then I  Did it without wine this is an experiment I conducted on myself, and it was not as fun Composing without the influence of just some you know a smooth sort of low-level sort of wine buzz But I looked at the two  There was no contest. My completely sober writing was vastly better than what I was writing under the influence of several glasses of wine, even though I believed it was really good. But hold on a second. What kind of writing are you talking about? If you're talking about fiction? No, no, prose. Okay. Prose. One of the greatest examples of fiction being enhanced under the influence of drugs and chemicals is Stephen King. If you go and read Stephen King's early work versus the stuff after he got sober, and I'm a gigantic Stephen King fan,  Was it just alcohol in his case or were there other drugs? Cocaine. Oh, other drugs too. A lot of cocaine, a lot of alcohol, cigarettes, a lot of cigarettes. It was way better. It's vastly superior. Darker, deeper, stranger. In the day. More bizarre, more shocking. In the day, you're saying? In the day. Read it today. Read Cary today. No, no, no, I meant you're saying what he created in the day under that influence. Yes, the stuff under the influence, the stuff he created under the influence. Cary is deeply dark. Oh my gosh. It's so dark. Oh yeah. It's so dark. So is Pet Sematary. Almost all of them. When was Shoreshank Redemption? I think all of them were when he was fucked up. He wrote some good stuff after he was fucked up, but like Cujo, he doesn't even remember writing it. And it's fantastic. So is this something you would recommend? I recommend Stephen King. Get back on Coke, sir. Stay off Twitter. Get back on Coke. I'm kidding. So what my little experiment with glasses of wine. Yeah, that's not enough that experiments not enough like I Personally feel that under the influence of marijuana I come up with some of my best ideas for comedy for stand-up comedy writing I like to I do the George ready to drop. Yes. I love your work. Thank you very much I do the George Carlin method. I write sober and then I punch it up high. I  Okay, and sometimes George Carlin had a great point. He's like you should write about things that you're thinking about and things that are like Important or things that are on your mind And then he would like let it sit and then he would smoke pot and go back to it And then he would come up all the funny interesting ridiculous aspects of it, and he would interject them into Yeah, yeah, so so I'm just saying to the extent. I'd be I'd like to know how reliable that is Well, here's the other point that I should say there's many people that don't do any drugs that write fantastic stuff And there's many comedians that are completely clean and sober that have done their best work once they got clean and sober That's true, too. Both those things are true, right? But there I think they're tools and we've lost some comedians, but I mean, you know, Mitch Hedberg, for example, but he Really bad drug his injectable heroin thing, which is one of the worst but the point is it's like  They're tools, and I used to have a joke about it, like that marijuana is like any other tool. It's like a hammer. You could build a house with a hammer, or you could hit yourself in the dick if you're fucking crazy. And that's the problem with all sorts of things. They need to be managed responsibly, and people need to understand what the effects are, what the dosage is, and that's where science comes in. Okay, here's what I'll do. Here's what I'll do. I still have some writing projects that I'm going to finish. Can I take mushrooms? No. When I'm done with what I know I wanted to write before I died, then I will consider this. Then come to daddy. I'll come to papa. I'll come to papa. We'll hook you up. And then I'll see if some new creative thing comes out of me at that point. Well, I don't know if new creative things will come out of you, but I think thoughts will come out that probably wouldn't exist without them. And when you're talking about really breakthrough psychedelic moments like DMT or mushroom psilocybin, one of the really fascinating things is they mimic neurochemistry. Like DMT is in the brain, and it's in all the organs, and it's a part of natural human neurochemistry. Well, except, of course, so is fentanyl. Fentanyl is a part of the human neurochemistry? No, no, you have receptors for it. Right, but DMT is produced by the human body. It's actually a thing that the body makes, and we don't know why. And the really heavy-duty psychedelic people think that in large doses, when you take it and have these breakthrough experiences, what you're doing is you're going through some sort of chemical portal. And this chemical portal is only available to people in these near-death experiences, under extreme moments of stress, where they have, like, these moments where they go through the tunnel and the bright light, and they meet God. I mean, how many of these  would I have to see to be convinced that it's a reliable consequence of it? I think you'd have to do it. I think this conversation is like talking to a person who's lived in an underground tunnel their whole life, who's dismissing sunlight. They're like, what's the big deal with sunlight? I'm fine down here with light bulbs and you and your sunlight. Oh yeah, photosynthesis. I've got hydroponics. So you're being a very effective drug pusher. Hmm, but the drugs that I'm interested in are not dangerous. They're not ones that kill you like I've never done cocaine I've never done heroin. I've never done amphetamines. I'm not interested cocaine kill you It can can if you're rich enough Well, it certainly can kill you today because so much of it is laced with fentanyl. Which is one of the number one killers of young people, unfortunately, is fentanyl contamination of drugs. But I'm interested in pharmacology. I'm interested in what happens to the mind when it's under the influence of different substances. Yeah, I guess I'm less interested because I don't... I have to think more about what you said. Look at how people misinterpret reality when they're not on anything. It's a good point. And it's another good point is there's many people that under the influence of those drugs. The failure of eyewitness testimony just to say what actually happened. Sure. And that's under stringed arrest. That's scary. People end up in jail because of that. Yes. For the rest of their lives. Yes. Well, listen, I've had many, many conversations with people on this podcast about that. Because I've worked with my friend Josh Dubin, who was originally an ambassador for the Innocence Project. And he's done a bunch of stuff on his own, where he's gotten many, many, many people out of jail. The fact that an Innocence Project even has to exist in this world is itself a travesty. Well, I'm hoping that with science, there's going to come a time where we can actually read the contents of people's minds. And that this will no longer be, I remember this. It's an episode of Black Mirror on that. Yes, yes, yes. But I think maybe, yes, that would be interesting. But isn't the problem is that false memories are a real thing? So there are people who believe something. And if you read their mind, you'll just see what it is that they believe. But I wonder if you could sort of back engineer that belief I wonder if it could get to the point where you could say oh You believe this because this is a memory of the way you've described the memory black mirror Style and you have a chip that records everything that you see. That's probably the future chapter here called I'm  Law and order where I get into the role of science in deciding whether someone is guilty or innocent and It's the idea that in a courtroom someone says I need a witness. This is like  In the court of science, that is the last thing you are ever asking for. Because we know, psychologists knew this first, the rest of us figured it out after the fact, that Iowanus testimony is one of the least reliable forms. The third time, I was rejected from jury duty. I show up dutifully, okay? And... The third time, they said there was a woman who was robbed on the street of her groceries and her purse. And they had the person who she accuses positively identifies and her. And it's a literal he said, she said. We read the particulars of the case. She said he robbed her of the groceries, took it, and then ran off. When the cops found the guy, he was not in possession of anything she said he took. They looked in the area for anything stashed in dumpsters, they didn't find anything. So that's the state of the case. And the judge reads the particulars and goes to the, I'm down to the last 15, I'm almost on a jury. For the first time in my life, I'm almost there. And said, do you have any? What does anyone have any think they would not be able to convict based on the kind of information then evidence that's been presented and And there's a juror 14, whatever you numbered right until you're selected Said would you have any but I said yes, I'd have a problem if the only evidence available is eyewitness testimony Then everything I know about it  Tells me I should not trust it on the level where you end up putting someone in jail It's like so I could not convict if that's the only evidence you have what the judge said next was Are there any other jurors like juror 14?  who said who needs more than one witness before they would be able to convict and And I said, should I jump in now and say, that's not what I said, what should I do? The person in front of me said, your honor, that's not what he said. Okay? And I said, oh, thank you. Thank you, Jesus. He said, that's not what he said. And I resisted with all my might to say, your honor, you were eyewitness to what I said 20 seconds ago and got it wrong. But I resisted, but I was nonetheless on the street 20 minutes later. I think you should have said that just for his own edification. No, it was a she, by the way. Sorry, I'm sexist. You're totally sexist. What's wrong with me? We've all known that forever. Slapped myself on the wrist. I'm just saying it's clear that the legal system, the precision of- Deeply flawed. It's deeply flawed. And they'll say, well, it's the best we have. Well, then fix it. I mean, if that's how you were talking, when they used to dunk people, and if you died face up, you were innocent, and died face down, you were guilty. That was the best they had then, but we improved on it. Right. If they drowned you, you weren't a witch. Congratulations, you weren't guilty. Well, it depends, yeah, if you, that's right, how you died, and you'd otherwise go to heaven, where you would want to go. So, plus there's, in Columbus's voyage, there's a lot, we talked about Columbus last time on the show. Oh, I talked about Columbus many times. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's horrific. So, in one of the voyages, they went on some stretch of time, and they didn't have food, and they had Indians from their,  that they brought on board as well as some of their own crew and people were dying and so at sea, what do you do with a dead body? You throw it overboard, of course, okay? So, a person who's keeping notes said all the Indians they threw overboard  Floated face down and all the Christians Okay Okay, I guess that could happen Statistically perhaps I don't know But now we have his handwritten notes. I witness testimony of something that is completely fulfilling his own worldviews expectations of how things should be So that's so in the whole sort of law and order chapter I just take pick all that apart and just try to say You know, why not have jurors that are really good at data analysis. How about that? That would be nice, but that's really hard to find. And then on top of that, if you are dealing with eyewitness testimony, what do you do? Do you just throw everything out completely? Or do you try to assess whether or not that person is capable of objective thought and reasoning? No, you just, no. Because even people who are better at it are still flawed at it. Right. Especially under experiences, under extreme stress. Stress experience. Correct. They've done many times in psychology class they have you know the class is unfolding and they stage some violent thing with an explosion and then say write what you just saw right right and Nothing agrees, okay, so Yeah, it's a it's a it's a challenge. Which is the problem of conspiracy theories after big events like 9-eleven  Like all the people that say they saw this, and they saw that, and I remember this, and I remember that. And you have these little sound bites of all these people, and you piece them together like, oh my god, they planted bombs. And also, there are people who say, before an earthquake,  They knew it was gonna happen. They see all the animals running, and it's like, okay, you reported that after the earthquake happened, not, like, before. But doesn't that happen during tsunamis? Don't animals actually do go to higher ground? I think that has actually been documented. Okay, so I'm highly suspicious of whether that's true. Because a tsunami there's there's no way to know that Tsunami typically occurs from an earthquake way offshore right okay, and it's a very low  amplitude wave in deep water that continues to gain amplitude as the water gets shallower and shallower. So that's why waves get bigger when they crash on the shores. So as it comes to the shore, so if you're just an animal in the woods, if you're not on the shoreline, there's no way to know that. I think they were talking about animals on islands and animals that do live closer to the shore. And maybe there's an indication because the water pulls back. before a tsunami? Sure, I can recognize that. But if you're just an animal somewhere onshore, away from the coast, I don't really see that. I need to see very good evidence for that, and not just someone's account. Yeah, I don't know if they're talking about- This is my whole point. People have accounts of all kinds of things. Do you know, there's a whole other chapter called risk and reward. All right, here's something. Surely in your life, you have taken an average of numbers before. Okay, tell me yes sure lie to me even if it's not sure Okay, do you realize? That the first time anyone ever did that To realize that maybe there's some interesting result here was after the invention of algebra trigonometry geometry and calculus  Really? Statistics is just something that the human brain, it's just not natural. It is completely foreign to us. We don't know how to interpret simple random events because we want to give meaning to them. You know the thing where you're in some other country in some other city and you meet someone like a childhood friend. And you say, small world. Yeah, that's your first thought right small world. Okay. Here's here's how to cure that okay next time you're in a foreign city go up to every single person you walk by and say do I know you and They'll probably say no. I mean know you personally. They'll know you cuz you're dude, but No, just keep doing this and If they say no, I don't know you then say big world Just do that  You'll do that millions of times before you meet someone who you once knew. And the proper statistics will then get recorded for that. So no, it's not a small world. It's a fucking big world. And there are a lot of people in it who you don't know. It's just very unusual when you meet someone in another country that you know from back home. No, no, no. There's a point where, well, if you do the math, there are a lot of things that people say are unusual where it would be unusual if you didn't. Well, if you fly to England and you don't tell anybody you're flying to England and you run into a friend from back home, that's pretty unusual. Look how often people say that it happens. Well, we live in a strange world now. That's precisely my point. Everybody you know has that story. If you run the statistics on it, it would be odd if you went your life. Presumably you have a normal life and you know people and your school was big and all of this, okay? You didn't grow up in a farm with nobody, you didn't know anybody. It requires some basic number of people. So there's a lot of errors of statistics that we make, of probability and statistics. The sad part of it is there's an entire industry that has risen to exploit that fact, and they're called casinos. The fact that you could go to a roulette table and somebody's got a lot of money on seven.  I said, why do you have money on seven? It's due. What do you mean it's due? Well, look at the previous rolls, because they'll show you the previous rolls, and seven hasn't appeared in 20 rolls or whatever the number is they put. So it's due. No, it's not due. This is a failure of the human brain to understand and interpret probability and statistics. There are people who are gonna roll dice, okay? If they need a low number, they'll take the dice and like gently roll them. If they need a high number, they'll throw them hard. This is crazy. But those people are suckers. There's other people that do understand statistics and they kick them out of casinos because they count cards. Only for those that are not purely random like a roulette table or dice. You mean things like blackjack. Correct. You can tilt the odds in your favor a little bit and be systematic about it. But I'm talking about pure probabilities. The fact that someone thinks that a number is due.  is itself. Do you realize the American Physical Society, these are my physics peeps, that's our physics society. 1986, they were gonna have their annual meeting in San Diego, and there was a hotel snafu, so they had to reschedule. And so Vegas said, we'll take you, the MGM Marina, which became the MGM Grand, we'll take you. 4,000 physicists said, okay. 4,000 physicists had their annual meeting in Las Vegas, and let me tell you, Okay? K through 12, is there even a course offered in probability and statistics? You learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, not reading, writing, and probability and statistics, right? It's kind of not there. And if it's there, it's an elective, okay? So. As a scientist, especially as a physical scientist, I take some form of probability and statistics every single year I am in school. Different nuances and how data can be looked at and analyzed and put together and averaged. The average that I told you about, you add numbers, divide by that. That's one of a dozen kind of ways you can average numbers. There are other ways. You can have a statistically weighted average. It depends on the needs, depends on the situation. Point is, the physicist came to Vegas. One week later, there was a news headline, physicists in town, lowest casino take ever. This is it. We're told to never return to Vegas. Really? Yes. They were told to never return? They were told. Well, that might be apocryphal, but it was in the headline. Really? Yeah. That's funny. These are people. These are my peeps. This is what we do. A little too smart. It's not because we took advantage of the blackjack table. It's because they just simply didn't gamble. Well, I'm the same way. I don't gamble either. I just look how big the place is. I'm like, how is this made? By selling tickets to the buffet? I don't think so. I don't think so. No, this is made from suckers. Me and my wife went a few months ago. Let's say you're winning in something. You're in the one-armed bandit and you had a jackpot. What do they do with you? At that point, they see this is happening. What does the house do? They check the machine. No, no, no. They check you. They give you free drinks. They give you free drinks. Yeah. They got a comely server to come over to you and say, would you like a free cocktail? Yes. To stir chemicals into your brain to disrupt the little bit of objective reality that you're experiencing. Release your inhibitions. You're feeling lucky. Are you feeling lucky, Neil? You're feeling lucky. Yeah. I don't feel lucky at all at casinos. I feel stupid. And another thing with the state lotteries if this is all in the in the in the Risk and reward chapter state lotteries. Do you know what most of the revenue? You know it's a state money right goes into the coffers right tax coffers You know where most of that money is allocated for in most states. No it goes to education and Oh, that's good. You didn't know that? No, that's great. Yeah, it's cool. So that makes you feel a little better like you're helping out your own state when you buy your state lottery. Here's the thing. Part of me wonders, OK, let me join you in a conspiracy thing here, OK? OK. It's my conspiracy. OK. Am I allowed? Yes, please. Am I allowed one per year? Please do. I'll give you all the ones you want. I love a good conspiracy. The conspiracy is they have to make sure that the school curriculum  does not teach probability statistics. What? What? Because if they did- Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. If they did, then no one would play the lottery. So they allocate money to education with a specific mandate that you can't- No, I'm not saying that. What are you saying? Yes, I'm saying that. No, I'm just saying it's a little suspicious that the very knowledge of math that would undermine the ability of the state lottery to make money is not a required part of the math curriculum in kindergarten through 12. So you think but you don't think that's why. I'm just playing with that. No, I don't really think that's why right No, okay, so I see what you were doing there You were assuming that I was totally in on this conspiracy theory and I have charts on my wall and websites devoted to no It just crossed my mind how odd it is that when you know enough about probably you bet less and And when you bet less, the revenue to the state would drop, and that's the revenue that would go to education. So it has the power to plant the seeds of its own undoing, and it doesn't do that. I'm intrigued by that fact. Just removing ourselves from the conspiracy theory aspect of it, do you think that it would be beneficial to teach probability and statistics to people? Oh my gosh! A long list. Look at how many bad decisions we make. Yeah. Because we think we have an understanding of what is random and what is not. Right. There's the one, they did this, but actually their analysis was flawed, but the basis was well placed. So the idea, you're playing a basketball game, and somebody hits a few shots in a row, they've got a hot hand, give it to them. Yeah. They don't have a hot hand. It is the natural consequence. If you're shooting 50 percent in a game, or 40 percent, and you take, I don't know how many shots, you take 30 shots, you can look at the probability that you'll have multiple shots in a row that are made. And it's very high, and it's very real. So it's not something special happening. It is the randomness of the statistics that's happening. OK, but this is talking about statistics, but from an individual basis. Do you discount the idea that sometimes people feel really good, and they have a very good sense of where the ball's going, where they're more loose or relaxed or more practiced, whatever it may be, and they're more accurate because of that? If that's the case, no, so people have good days, right? Clearly. So this is why that original analysis was slightly flawed. Because a person can have more than what is typical shots in a row. And for that game, you could look at their data, and they would make 60% of the shots instead of 40% of the shots. And if you make 60% of the shots, you then expect three in a row here, six in a row there, five in a row here. In the random expression of having a 60% success rate in a basket, you expect intervals where you make multiple shots in a row. That's my only point. And that could be a good day for you because you're shooting 60%. And I want to recognize that. I'm going to hand you the ball if you're having a good day. You can totally have a good day. But at the end of the day, you're not sinking 20 here and none before it, no. The statistics maintain themselves in the game, unless you get injured or something, of course. But my point is, we have such, and I don't want to blame people for this. If it was natural to think statistically about the world, it would have been the first branches of math we would have ever discovered. But it wasn't. It was like 1753, sounds like a long time ago, but it's 50 years after calculus was invented. After calculus, which is not even taught in school. Not long ago at all, really. Okay, correct. There's a simple paper on the benefits of taking the mean, mean is average, of observations in astronomical data. This is what an astronomer did it, first to take a mean. And this is just, so that tells me we are victims of our own brain wiring. And so, and it takes many years to undo that wiring, or to see through it, so that you are not, you know, and it prevents you from seeing other things, okay? How so?  Do you realize last year we lost as many people in the United States to traffic accidents  We did in all the years we fought in Vietnam Look at the effort we put up as a country beginning maybe 1967 certainly 68 to stop the carnage and That's just the American deaths not to mention the millions of deaths of the Vietnamese themselves north and south point is  reactions to statistics are very different depending on what Caused it. Yes, and that's I'm intrigued by that. I don't have a good understanding of it Any laws that Treat it are gonna have to fold in people's emotions. Here's an example You you shoot deer with your bow and arrow? There's a certain number of  Deer deaths and human deaths by cars hitting deer in the roads, especially in suburban rural Places. Okay. Well, what do you do about this? What are you gonna do get a truck with a big-ass bumper? That's what they do out here. The Joe Rogan solution. That's the Texas solution. You ever see those guys that work on ranchers? Make sure your truck has significantly more mass than the deer. No, they have specific bumpers that they build to save people's lives. Right and of course this is what the old locomotives had if there were cattle on the you ever see that pointy front on locomotive Yes, yes, that was the pride catalog. Yes, it wouldn't roll over the cow and derail the right so So what do you do do you accept? the hundred deaths a year in your county, whatever, human deaths, no one's counting deer deaths here, right? Or do you find something- Get yourself a big ass bumper. Oh, there you go, big ass bumper. Deer killer bumpers, look at those suckers. That's what I'm talking about. I like the Ford F-250 right there. That's what I'm saying. Look at that one, the Ford F-250, that red one, that's what I'm talking about. The problem is if the center of mass of the deer is above the level of that bumper- But it's not. Well, for elk it would be, for moose it would be. My wife grew up in Alaska. No. Yes. No, not a 250. F-250?  Center of mass of an elk. A moose. A moose. A moose, yes. I'm talking moose. Moose is a different thing, yeah. I saw a moose. My wife grew up in Alaska. When you see one for the first time, you're like, how is that real? What the hell is that? The first time I saw a moose, I was in British Columbia, and I saw it. It was like the scene in Jurassic Park where Jeff Goldblum gets out of the Jeep and he's like, Yeah, it's like, who invented that? What? Look at the size of that thing. So if you're under the center of mass, then it will just roll up and crush your windshield. So you have to watch out for that. Go through your windshield. Yeah, it's horrific. So here's my point. There is a group, I forgot where, somewhere in New England, who did a study. And the study was, if you have 100 deaths a year, we can drop that to maybe 30 deaths a year. How? By introducing  the natural cat predator to the deer. So it would be like the puma or bobcat, one of these sort of mid-sized cats that hold the deer as their quarry. And they ran some models of how this would go. And you could drop the number of human deaths by a factor of three. Because still some deer would wander onto the road. You'll lose about 10 children a year. They'll just snatch your kid out of the backyard and eat your child. So look at these numbers. You killed 100 people in their cars or or the deer kill 30 people plus 10 children. No, no the the deer killed 30 people the bobcat kills 10 and bucket might not kill an adult not by cat But whatever is not next mountain lion. That's the word whatever was native in the region long ago Okay, and so they did a study and the point is you could not bring that suggestion forward, right? because the government would be introducing an animal that killed your children and  But no one's looking at the hundred people that were whatever the numbers were it was a factor of three or so I know there's another so the correct numbers are in the book. No.  I'm just giving this as an example. I understand of We don't we're not equipped to fold our emotions with the data to arrive at a solution  that would save the most lives. I see what you're saying. There is a technological solution that they've come up with. There's a device that they put at the front of the car that makes a very certain sound that alerts deer to the presence. I've heard about that. It's right on the edges of the... I've heard about that, but I haven't read about it. 20 years ago, so I haven't heard much about it. I don't know how effective it is It runs the air going through it makes a kind of a siren effect. Is that what yeah, but when I last remembered it Yeah, well, whatever it is. It develops some sort of a sound that the deer can hear and they avoid it but  They have a problem. I wasn't I was in Alaska and there was a deer and a Grizzly bear must have been 300 yards away, but way down in the valley and the deer noticed it and it was eating but is eating very cautiously always looking to the bear and I'm saying if he could notice a bear 300 yards and be cautious of it and  Why can't it know a Ford 250 barreling down a road? Because it's not natural. Figure it out! It's a mammal, it's got a brain! That takes forever. Let me get angry with the deer for a second. And how come we haven't killed all the stupid deer by now, so the ones that are left are the ones that recognize that cars kill them? Because they're all stupid. They just have really good senses. They have senses that are designed to avoid predation. But they're living with us now. But how long have they had headlights? Mice and rats figured out how to coexist with humans. Rats are very intelligent. They figured this out. Yeah, but deer don't know what to do with headlights and cars. It's a completely unnatural thing. So everyone that doesn't, they die, and the ones that have a little bit of genetic variation that figures it out, they'll survive. Sort of, because then they get horny. The problem with deers, if you look at the number of deaths... Sorry, I don't know anything about the sex life of deer. I do. Okay. One of the things that happens is the uptick... Don't tell me how you know. Well, the rut. When deer rut is when you hunt them, and one of the things that happens during the rut is they get ridiculous, and they just run out into traffic. They chase does into the street. That's oftentimes does. The male deer chase the female deer. Because they're just chasing them. The females are just trying to get away, and they just run out into traffic. That happens. Or the male is trying to chase the female, and all he's got on his mind is he's got tunnel vision, and they just, boom, gets hit by that F-250. Speaking of deer, by the way, my sister drives an F-250. Or is it a 450? Is there a 450? No, she drives a 350, excuse me. Oh, she has a dually? Yeah, she's got one where the tires can do separate things. Oh, okay. Up with the side, yeah. Oh, she's serious. Don't mess with my sister. Okay, is your sister out there off-roading? What is she doing with that crazy truck? She likes being badass when the time comes. I like the way she thinks. But she doesn't hunt, so it's missing half the equation there. So, on the subject of deer,  in the chapter on gender and identity. So I go there, gender and identity, because it's a very hot topic. And I just apply some rational thinking to it. Do you know about Santa's reindeer? Do you know about them? Sure, I know very much about them. Oh, you do? Yeah. Okay, so do you know that- A caribou. Yes, a caribou, correct. And well, you can domesticate the caribou, and when you do,  then both the boys and the girls have antlers, okay? Well, that's just the fact of all caribou. Oh, all caribou, excuse me. But sorry, the domesticated ones are called reindeer, but they're derived from the caribou, correct. So now watch what happens. So, as you may know, the male deer lose their antlers in late October, early November. Depending upon what where those you castrated they don't castrate them. They'll keep their yeah, but otherwise they drop their antlers right before winter begins  Generally, not. No. Well, it depends on the animal, but a lot of them keep it until almost spring, and then they drop and they grow back very quickly. That's nothing of what I've read or learned of this animal. From deer? Or just caribou? No, caribou specifically. Just caribou. Okay. The ones that became Santa's reindeer. We're not talking about the deer in central Texas. No.  They dropped them in the winter. They dropped them in November, okay? The female don't. The female don't. So all that means is all eight of Santa's reindeer are female which means Rudolph has been misgendered. Interesting. Well do you know where the myth of Santa's reindeer flying comes from. I think it's from mushrooms, isn't it? Yeah, Amanita muscaria mushroom, which looks like Santa Claus. Yeah. That's it. With the red and white dots. And they love those things. They love the Amanita muscaria mushroom to the point where when people are doing mushroom ceremonies and they go outside to urinate... Caribou will knock you over to get to your urine. If you have domesticated caribou, they will knock you over to get to the urine because they smell the amanita muscaria and whatever the, it's not psilocybin. It has to be such a major, I'm trying to imagine how high I want to get to drink someone else's pee. Well, caribou are not that wise, nor are they educated, nor do they even understand the concept of urine. Whatever the psychoactive compound, well, their sense of smell is preposterously intense. I mean, we can't even imagine what a deer can smell. They can smell you hundreds of yards away. I mean, I've seen deer go like this 100 yards away, and then they bolt because they smell you. They catch your wind. Yeah, they're amazing. Here's a mystery that I've always had. to this day, because dogs have very acute sense of smell as well. That's how you say that. If you just say dogs smell good, you don't know what that means, right? Do they smell better than we do? It's an ambiguous sentence, that's all. So they have acute sense of smell. So if they smell so acutely, why do they get within like a half inch of each other's butt? Because they want to smell each other. But you could smell that 100 yards away? Yeah, but they want to smell everything. They want to smell the hormones. Even more. Yeah, well, they're intensely attracted. Okay, so it's so good, let me get up on it. Yeah, they want to know if you're feeling aggressive, if you're in the heat. They want to know all those things. Yeah, I never had that urge to do that with other humans. You know, a bear can smell somewhere in the neighborhood of nine times greater than a bloodhound. So we should domesticate bears and track down. Good luck with that. By the way, have you seen a bear? You gotta be able to find this. It's on, I saw it on social media. There's a bear walking down a highway, and there's a tipped over traffic cone, and it looks at it, and then it writes it back up and keeps walking by it. Wow. And I say to myself, because I have a chapter in here called Body and Mind. There it is, check this out. Just watch. It's a black bear. Clearly. Yeah, it looks wrong. Okay. By the way, you found this video really fast. Thank you for this. I think that's a grizzly bear. Oh, he's got the lump on the neck? Yeah, the way he looks. That's pretty crazy. Yeah, it's grizzly. That's total grizzly bear. And it keeps going. Didn't even look back. Right. So I don't want to say that's evidence of intelligence so much as it's evidence of more going on inside the animal's head than any of us would have previously ever credited. In another example, and I get this example in body and mind again, there's a magpie. who there's a bottle of water in some playground area, park area, and it goes up to the bottle of water and it dips its beak in to drink from it. Okay, here it is, see this? Okay, it goes in and drinks from it. So watch, it's gonna drink, but the problem is there's a limit to how far its beak can reach inside of it. And so it gets a stone,  that fits inside the bottle, which raises the water level so that its beak can continue to drink from it. This is some Archimedean crazy stuff going on. The magpie, by those in the know, is ranked among the smartest of birds. And this is doing something I think humans wouldn't even think to do. Probably many humans. Right. And so do you remember, how did they teach you where humans were in the tree of life when you were in school? Like we were the smartest or the biggest brain. How did they describe it to you? Yeah, we're the top of the food chain. OK. And what did they say about our brains? Just tell me in your. Well, it's the size of our brains that makes us so superior. But then you look at a magpie. Yeah, but dolphins' brains are bigger. Yeah, 40% larger. OK, so then therefore, what is, you know,  Whale brains are bigger, so yeah, so so then how did they if if there are other animals with bigger brains? And we want to stay at the top. What do they say about those other animals? No, I'm saying okay, so you know what they did they say they're inferior so no so what they do is say they say oh No, we don't have the biggest brain. Oh, but  brain to body weight ratio, then we're the highest, okay? Is that accurate with dolphins? Yes. Because they're bigger, much bigger creatures than we are. When you divide the weight of the brain by the weight of the body, we win. Right. We beat out  Whales, we beat out dolphins, we beat out elephants. Then there are those who are fans of those say, well you want to do it lean weight because those, the dolphins and the whales have a lot of blubber and that's not, the brain is not having to control the blubber. So cut away the blubber, that boosts them but they're still not as high as us. So we walk away saying we're at the top. However, what they did not say, which I had to, 40 years later I learned this,  that we do not have the highest brain-to-body weight ratio among animals, only among mammals. The magpie has a higher brain-to-body weight ratio than humans do, as do all other mid-sized birds, like crows, owls, eagles, these folks, okay? All have a higher brain-to-body weight ratio than humans do. So that rule that put us at the top  was specifically for mammals. And I'm angry that I didn't think to hear how specific that was when I was taught that in eighth grade. Isn't our understanding of like crows using tools very recent, like within the last hundred years? All I can tell you is any animal that we have ever got to study in more detail than we previously did,  has shown to be more intelligent than we ever gave it credit for being. And you know who has the biggest brain-to-body ratio of any creature on Earth? Some species of ants really 15% of their body weight is their brain And it's kind of obvious some of them like the whole front section is their head right. It's kind of in retrospect It's kind of obvious and ants are very busy doing some complicated things, and we don't know what they're doing especially leafcutter ants They're busy carpenter ants leafcutting ants and crossover into termite land I don't know how big their brains are but they're busy doing building stuff and they work in communication with each other they communicate yeah One of my favorite cartoons was two dolphins swimming together, and there's a human up, you know, it's like one of these water parks, right? And one dolphin says to the other, speaking of the humans that are up on dry land, they face each other and make noises, but it's not clear they're actually communicating with each other. So I'm just saying, we have. Close-up of an ant yeah, that's just that recently released this image. I think yeah so With a horrific demon that would be insects with so much detail on their bodies and to say well We're at the top really I got one for you. How much of the top are you do you realize one slice of? Your lower intestine your colon Once a one centimeter slice of  lives and works more microbes than the total number of humans who ever lived. So ask yourself, what are you to those microbes? Are you Joe Rogan? No, you are an anaerobic vessel of fecal matter in which they thrive. And without them, you don't exist. Well, you don't digest your food, first of all. Second, you want to keep them happy, because if they're not happy, then they're in charge. They send you to the nearest toilet as fast as can be. So part of a cosmic perspective on this world is looking at things in a way that decentralizes who and what you are relative to everything else. And you get a much more honest account of how things work, how they're put together. That's very hard for people to really grasp. It's an ego. You're actually an ecosystem. Yes. Yes. And what is the number? Some percent of your total body weight is the weight of other living things, especially what's alive and thriving in your gut. You're just carrying them along. That's the case with all organisms, though. We like to think of organisms as being individuals, but they're actually hosts. Well, not all. Not when you get down to single cells. Not single cells. But others, yeah. A lot of symbiotic relationships going on. Oh, yeah. And so you can have a cosmic perspective that's not just the cosmos. Yes. Cosmic perspective just here, life on Earth. And they talked about the overview effect, where the astronauts, you probably had a few astronauts here as your guests. Looking down. Yeah, you look you look down. I prefer the view from the moon. I'll take it from orbit Are you gonna do any of those like would you if they let you up on the Jeff Bezos spaceship? They send people up there all the time. Yeah. Yeah, so it's fairly regular. I'm an astrophysicist. You're not interested. No, let me hear me out. Yeah, so take Earth and Shrink it down to like a schoolroom globe. So now we can think of distances relative to that and ask how high up did Bezos and Branson go and Okay, so here's a school, but how far away would you say quarter-inch you say quarter-inch, okay? They went the thickness of two dimes oh and A boy who jumped out of a balloon some years ago. Yeah What's his name Felix Baumgartner mm-hmm thickness of one dime? So this idea that they go. No.  I see the curvature of the earth in this no you don't um  You don't, I'm sorry. Jeff Bezos doesn't see the curvature of the Earth when he goes up there? You'll see the edge of the Earth, but ask how far away is your horizon when you're only that high up? You can just look at that, go to the schoolroom globe, go two dime thicknesses up, and then draw a line to ask how much of Earth do you see? You'll see a circle, but that's a circle cookie cut out of the larger sphere. So it's a perspective issue. It's a perspective issue. And by the way, the images when they showed Felix Baumgartner, where he's prepared to jump, you see this curved earth. That's a fisheye lens, dude. OK. Fisheye lenses take horizontal lines and bend them. Convex when you're above the midplane of the of the photo in order to gather in more of the image correct That's the only way you can distort it to fit it onto a flat plane because it's looking at a full Sort of 360 well 180 all right, and it's trying to get it in But what happens if you take that horizontal line the horizon and put it below the midplane of the camera it then bends the other way and  Mmm bends the other way in fact. I have a I Have a tweet that did this look for Felix and put throw some keywords in there with my Twitter handle And I have a example of the photos so no he didn't see the curvature of the earth But you think he did and he's high up and what do we need NASA for right? He's one dot one dime thickness  Elon Musk authentically goes into orbit, because they didn't go into orbit. They went up and fell back to Earth. He authentically goes into orbit. So he is a centimeter. Well, not even. Let me see. Yeah, a little less than a centimeter above Earth's surface. The folks who really saw Earth were the folks that went to the moon. We went to the moon nine times. Three astronauts have popped. 27 astronauts have seen Earth from the moon. And that'll change you. Do you know Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell? I have a quote from him that opens this book. And that's all you have to read because the whole book issues forth from that quote. Here it is. Edgar Mitchell Apollo 14 You develop an instant global consciousness a people orientation and intense Dissatisfaction with the state of the world and a compulsion to do something about it. Mmm from out there on the moon International politics looks so petty you want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter million Miles out and say look at that you son of a bitch  Edgar Mitchell also believes some wacky stuff. Did you know that? Yeah, I've spoken with him about it and he He was one of the was he co-founder of the noetic Institute He was he was a big fan of the possibility that there was a deeper level of consciousness and I don't think it involved drugs, but just that there was a deeper level of consciousness of  That the brain might be capable of if subjected to the proper influences and He told me how he came across this. Okay, I'll tell you They're on their way back from the moon and they're in the capsule and the capsule rotates It helps to stabilize it among other reasons for that happening and he happened to be positioned in the capsule for three days and  where the windows to the capsule were aligned with the plane of the solar system, which means every time the capsule rotated, what came in and out of view was the sun, the moon, earth, and all the planets. And so he's there for three days watching this drift by. And he felt like he had  Descended or ascended into a trance state That was beyond what he had ever experienced here on earth by normal things you encounter just being a human on earth and That led him to wonder whether this was an achievable state by some other means  by some other forces that you could emulate here on Earth. And because he experienced that and I didn't, who am I to say? I'm not going to judge that. He believed in psychokinetics. He believed people can do things with their mind. He had a lot of very strange things that he was interested in. I think that the cleanest way to say that is he believed there was much more capacity of our mind than we had previously tapped. And that opens up the gates to all these other things. But I was just sharing with you the experiential origins of why he thought that way. But the point is that that can change you and In the chapter earth and moon I talk about cosmic Perspectives as as you ascend that the earth does not look like the schoolroom globe right color-coded countries You know only as an adult did I look back in that and I say you trained me to  from elementary school to know who my enemies are and who my friends are by color-coding contiguous landmasses on a globe to teach me about the planet Earth. But they weren't trying to do that. They were trying to explain- It's a consequence of it. Geography. I knew who the evil, godless Soviet Union was. Right. Okay? Their country was painted red. All right? Not ours. I knew this even if it was not on purpose. It had a subliminal effect. But when you go into space, the country borders go away. Except for two places. There are two places. You can still see two borders from space. One of them in the daytime. You can see the border of Israel with surrounding deserts. Because Israel irrigates. And so it's green, and the surrounding areas are brown. You can see that from space. Another border, which you can see from space at night, is, of course, North and South Korea, right there. Yeah. That's crazy. And that's punched up. I mean, if you were in the dead of night, you don't know the difference between the ocean and the land as your sight line crosses North and South Korea. So what you and if you look at the GDP per capita differences between Israel and surrounding nations and South Korea and North Korea, it's you know factors of eight nine ten twelve so Space can reveal  economic inequities in at least those two places, which is itself kind of a stunning fact. So I want to tell Elon, you're now neighbors with him, right? Get him back here and say, Elon, build a bus, a space bus. We have an air bus. Why not a space bus? A space bus where you put all the warring leaders. And send them to the moon, have them look back on Earth. Say, you know, we're fighting over that border. We are? Once they came back down, I think they'd just go right back to work. You think so? I just went to the Keck Observatory on Wednesday. Nice. It was amazing. Hawaii. Yeah. Big island. Very nice. Did you go to the base camp or all the way to the top? To base camp. Yeah. I went specifically there because I had an experience there. About, I was six, seventeen years ago, I went there and I caught it on a perfect night where the moon wasn't out and it was phenomenal. And the view is so astounding. There's so many stars, you see the Milky Way in such clear detail that you have a totally different perspective of the cosmos. You feel like you're flying through space with a windshield over your head like you're in a spaceship You know there's some other my entire PhD thesis involved mountain going it's a lost and  Ritual because now we we'd have what's called service observing you just write in what? Things you want to observe them what nights for how many hours and then they send you back the data there used to be a pilgrimage to the top of a mountain and you live nocturnally and You go to them and be up all night with the telescope and the universe. Yeah, there's a certain almost spiritual connectivity That that  brings upon you when it's just you alone. And there are moments that mountains are high up enough so that if clouds roll in, you're above the clouds. You're above the clouds. This is what makes it especially spooky, magical, mystical, Mount Olympus-like. Because you're on the top. There's no other land. It's just clouds. So it's you, the tops of clouds,  and the universe communing with the cosmos. Just the view of it is so astounding. And many people who go to Australia say, oh, you gotta see the southern skies. What they don't know when they say that is any clear sky anywhere in the world will get you that. In the southern hemisphere, only 15% of humans live there. So there's essentially no light pollution anywhere there. 85% of all humans in the north, you're hard pressed to find a completely dark sky in the north, leaving you to think that there's something magically beautiful and different about the southern sky. You're observing the northern sky. Hawaii's like 15 degrees north, so it's a lot of the southern sky as well. Point is, you have the best observing site in the world,  Which is why they want to put a 30-meter telescope there, and there's some conflict with the indigenous groups regarding that. And whether the mountain is sacred, and in what ways it's sacred, and the like. And so that's still going on, last I checked. I'm not surprised and I'm delighted that you had that experience. And now you know how I feel when I look up. I was baptized in, emotionally, psychologically baptized with the night sky in New York City's Hayden Planetarium. Because as a city kid, I grew up in the Bronx. We don't have a relationship with the night sky. You know, we might see the moon and an occasional planet. The setting sun, that's it. You look up. Couple of dots for stars. That's it. You see the tall buildings. Back then there was air pollution, light pollution. So my first night sky was the Hayden Planetarium. And to this day, I was nine years old. To this day, when I go to mountaintops, just as you experience, and I look up, I sit and I say, this is so beautiful. It reminds me of the Hayden Planetarium. That's funny. I know that's messed up, but that's how I feel. But it's not. And you've got a sky here with meteors. Yeah. I'm loving it, man. We have shooting stars. I'm loving it. Yeah. The view that I saw on Wednesday was not as good as the view that I saw whatever it was 16, 17 years ago. Wait, who laid out these stars? Oh, it's just there's LED panels. You didn't call me. You didn't call me on this one. No, they're not accurate. They just have dots. Dude. All right. At least you have stars. In my old pool in California, I had the star system of where, like, you know, I was born in August, so it's the constellation Leo. When you were born. Yeah, when I was born. Okay. Embedded into the ground of the pool. All right. There you go. There you go. Allegedly. You know, they're asking me to verify it. I'm like, wow, it looks like stars. But that view of the Keck Observatory, just even from the base station, it's so stunning that it does reset your understanding of where we are. And it makes you angry that we have so much light pollution that people are denied that. Because I think it changes the way people view our relationship with the cosmos. In fact, it goes even deeper than that. But let me quickly... comment that the There is an entire indigenous community in the world That is very concerned about the loss of very dark night skies because so much of the culture Relates to that night sky as part of what it values and what it passes down from one generation To the next and it goes beyond just the light pollution because now folks like your boy Elon  is launching, and I don't like the fact that they use the word constellation to refer to satellites, because that's my word, that's my people's word, constellations, they're actual stars. Not moving hardware. We got people talking to people. I can connect you. No, no, we're friends. You're using the wrong words. I feel completely at home. He's on the spectrum a bit. I'd say one out of six of my colleagues is probably on the autism spectrum. In retrospect, now that I look at, once you learn what the spectrum is, it used to be Asperger's and then they folded that in. There are colleagues who just would not relate to another person or a camera, but they were great in their lab and in their things. And so you say you're just not socialized. No, there's something else going on in there. Can I ask you a question about that? Do you think that that is an evolutionary advantage, that in some way people are developing in this manner so that they can concentrate on things like technology, like astrophysics, like these very specific things that require immense amounts of concentration? Extreme focus. Do you think there's possibly that human beings are developing in that way? specifically to accentuate our Ability to innovate so it would be very hard to draw that conclusion as some kind of modern force of evolution Because for that to be the case  What would have to happen is those who had this sort of autistic level of focus, so high-functioning autism, they would have to be making more babies than other people. Well, Elon is. He's out there doing his part. So they'd have to be making more babies relative to everyone else to affect the evolutionary path of modern civilization. And it's not clear that that's what's actually happening. So we have to ask, did that have any value historically? I mean, in the history of the evolution of our species. So, in the chapter, Body and Mind, I go over the variations that exist within our species. Huge variations in height, in weight, in speed, in all kinds of things. And you can ask, well, then what is normal? The day that we control the genome, is there going to be some place somewhere where there's a normal human and you're going to take your genome that you're about to control in your unborn child and say, let me adjust it so that it matches this so that all your senses are working as they're supposed to and all the proportions. Is that the future? We should ask that. Because if that's what you're going to do, you're going to homogenize the species. Yes. Do you realize I have a run here of content? I have a run of descriptions of what people have accomplished, okay? All right, so for example, there's a guy growing up, he wanted to play basketball, okay? And he wanted to be a professional basketball player, all right? So he worked really hard at it. And he just wasn't tall enough. So he says, you should give it up, take on, but he stayed with it, stayed with it. He said, no, basketball is for tall people. You're not tall, okay? He now plays for the Harlem Globetrotters. His name is Hotshot, what's his last name? Swanson. Well Muggsy Bogues is a great example of that, right? No, this guy is four feet five. Whoa. Yes, he's a genetic dwarf. People told him he can't play basketball and now he's one of the most popular basketball players. There he goes. Wow. Okay? Swanson, Hotshot Swanson. Okay? I'm making a different point. Yes, the best part of the point, right? The point is When you look at someone and they're not quote normal and then you start listing what you think they should not do in life Constraining the options that maybe they have ambitions that are greater than anything you imagined, right? and so  There's a letter. There's a letter beautifully written. Someone took a voyage on a steamship in 1915, and I reproduced the letter in here. Beautifully written, and this passenger was given a tour of their steamship, okay, by the captain, and this letter, I can't find it in here, but it's beautifully, I mean, is there time for me to read something? Can I do it? I gotta read it. Give me a second here. And talk among yourselves. Let me see. H, A, J, G. I got it. Okay. There it goes. Okay. Here's a letter. Okay. Again, this is in the body and mind chapter where we explore  Here it is. I had the wrong year. How about a letter written on April 10th, 1930, to Captain Von Beck of the U.S.  Line's S.S.  President Roosevelt? That's Teddy Roosevelt, of course. The captain had given a tour of the bridge to a passenger who later that day waxed poetic  about the experience. Again, I stood with the captain on the bridge, and he was quiet and composed in the presence of a million universes, a man with the power of a god. In imagination, I saw the captain standing on the bridge, gazing into the wide canopied heavens, and seeing the darkness sprinkled with stars, systems, and galaxies. That passenger was Helen Keller. 1904 graduate of Radcliffe College Okay So what? my point is And I have other there's a whole run of pages of things and there's a whole description of hotshot here Okay from the Harlem Go-Chart. My point is The moment you homogenize a quote normalize who and what humans should be You have cut off  So much of what has enriched civilization simply because people were different. Yes Simply because and and so if everybody's the same what kind of world I don't want to live in that world Give me give me a different world. Do you worry that I got another one here? Okay, okay um  You probably know this, but those who don't know the name, hold off on it, okay? Here it is. Jim Abbott. You know what Jim Abbott is? Sure. Okay. Some people won't, but here it goes. Jim Abbott wanted his whole life to be a professional baseball player, a dream shared by many American boys. Jim wanted to be a pitcher in the major leagues. He succeeded and played for many teams, chalking up a mixed record of wins and losses, but on September 4th, 1993, while playing,  For the storied... I don't remember. New York Yankees. Dude. I thought it was the Mets. No.  I'm not a baseball fan. He pitched a no-hitter. That's when no batter gets a hit in the entire game. There have been about 320 no-hitters in Major League history out of 220,000 games played. Due to a congenital birth defect, Jim Abbott was born without a right hand. Is Jim Abbott disabled? Is he? He pitched a fucking no-hitter for the New York Yankees. What I'm saying is, obviously not everyone who has a disability will achieve this way. Don't get me wrong here, but what I want to say is,  Look at what people would have told, and I have six other examples here, one right after another. What people would have told them coming up. And Temple Grandin among them. Probably the most famous autistic person there ever was. She's professor of farming at, was it the University of Colorado, somewhere in the West. Where, because she sees the world the way animals do, she could advise farmers in ways they can handle and herd cows that does not create stress in them. She figures stuff out. She has research papers. Yes. But you're going to say, oh, she's not the life of the party. Get her out of here. What are we doing? Can I give you an example? A personal example? What the hell? And so I was angry writing that chapter. I was angry. One more, I gotta go. Let me give you a personal example. My jujitsu instructor, John John Machado, was born on his left hand. He only has a thumb. He has a genetic defect where he has no fingers on his left hand. Call it a genetic feature. It is a feature because he's a multiple-time world champion Because of the fact that he was born with this one hand that didn't have fingers He developed a style of jiu-jitsu that enabled him you see his hand there, huh? He's one of the absolute best that's ever done it and he developed a style jiu-jitsu where he utilizes that left hand to get under chins because it's not encumbered by the fingers and And he slides it in there and sinks rear-naked chokes on people. And he also developed a style that didn't rely on grips. He developed a style that's overhooks and underhooks, which became modern no-gi jiu-jitsu, which is incorporated in mixed martial arts because in mixed martial arts, they don't wear the kimono. And people who have fingers probably would have never even thought to think that way. And people who saw Jean-Jacques Machado as a child said, oh, this poor child, he will never reach his full potential and turned out to be one of the greatest ever. Got one here. So. Oliver Sacks was a noted neurologist, pioneering entire subfields within his profession. He was also a bestselling author, describing the human brain as the most incredible thing in the universe. He led a remarkably varied life while suffering from a neurological affliction called prosopagnosia, more commonly known as face blindness. This condition contributed to his severe shyness, since he couldn't recognize faces, even if he recognized everything else about you. At times, he would not even recognize his own face in the mirror. Whoa. And he's shy because if he's interested in a- How does that work? If he has a love interest,  If he has a love interest, he doesn't know the next time he sees that person, whether that was who he had the conversation with. Okay. In 2012, after a lecture on hallucination at Cooper Union College in New York City, I asked him, if you could go back in time, would you take a magic pill in your youth to cure your neurological disorder without hesitation? He replied, no. His entire professional interest in the human mind was inspired by the very disorders in his own brain. He wouldn't have it any other way. How does that work? Where they can't see faces, but they can read? They can see faces, they just don't recognize them. It doesn't land in any place that you recognize. Every face, even if you've seen it before, is like a brand new face. Wow. So he'd have to recognize your voice, your vocabulary, your accents, your body gestures, this sort of thing. Wow. So doesn't Brad Pitt supposedly have that? That, I don't know. I don't know. Proxbogagnosia? Yeah. Let's see if that's true. I felt like he said he has some form of that. Is that what he told one girlfriend when he saw the next one? Is that what you're saying? How dare you? Yeah, he does? He has some variant on that? What does it say? Yeah, he explained that. He hasn't officially been diagnosed with it. He has extreme difficulty recognizing people's faces. Wow, so maybe there's a varying spectrum. Yeah, of course, as there would be in anything. Yeah, there it is. Yeah, yeah. Face blindness. That's a very recent article there in this past year. How crazy is he? He's got one of the best faces ever, and he can't recognize his faces. Yeah. So all of this you'd expect.  to happen on some kind of spectrum of severity, let's call it, or featurity. And depending on where you are on that spectrum, you will have certain access to ways people have never thought before, ways people have never done things before. Have you seen the video of the woman somewhere in East Asia who has no arms? And she gets out of bed, folds up her, takes care of her child, puts on her makeup. With her feet. With her feet. Yeah. With her feet. Yeah. And so, uh, yeah, she puts on her makeup and puts on her coat, puts on, there's a whole video about this. And so I, I don't know what else to tell you. Oh, you must know this, my other guy here. You must, you must know him. If not, get him on. Okay. Get the dude on your show. Hang on. This is a study show. One in 50 people may have developed that face blindness. It could be genetic, but this doesn't say. Developmental. Hmm. Yeah. It's interesting. But how is it that he always winds up with hot women? Come on, Brad. He said people don't believe him because they think it's self-absorbeness and stuff. Oh, that's interesting. That's interesting. Here's another one. You ready? Yes.  Matt Stutzman. I recognize the name. Is a championship archer. Oh yes. Who can outshoot most people who have ever wielded a bow and arrow. He's actually coached by my friend John Dudley. In competition. Yeah. By a bow and arrow in competition. He's also a car enthusiast. Oh. He was born without arms. Yes. He shoots his arrows and fixes his cars using his uncommonly nimble legs feet and toes is Matt Stutzman disabled. All I'm here to say is because you started this conversation asking me on the spectrum of of  Autism where at some point in that spectrum you focus like no one has can focus before right? possibly to the exclusion of personal hygiene and other concerns related to your health and  Civilization has definitely benefited from those who have been able to focus in such a way. Yeah, so maybe our species and civil I'm just Spitballing here that our species and the advance of civilization itself has pivoted on the fact that in the variation of who what and what we are some of us  can focus and solve a problem like it was the most important thing we would ever do in our lives and end up doing so.  thereby pivoting civilization into Some future that would have not otherwise been realizable. So Yeah, I'm I'm all there. Yeah I mean the diversity of human beings and their interests and what they look like and their sizes and the way they interact with the world is one of the reasons why we can create such an amazing world and  But consider also and it goes it goes beyond just this what we call these disabled features right people with disabilities It goes to other things for example that you must know that it was not until 1987 where the American Psychiatric Association with some names such as that but the psychiatrists and  removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from their records from their encyclopedia 1987 yeah a disorder and so what does that even mean if But whatever the number is 10 20% of people or higher are on a gender spectrum as measured in the multiple dimensions that have revealed have been revealed in recent years If you had control over the genome of your children 50 years ago, and if homosexuality has a genetic component, would you say, I don't want that. That's abnormal because you're going to go through that list of what is normal. And you can say, I don't want any abnormalities in my children. Not at all. So there's an entire ethical frontier that is yet to be touched. Yet to be resolved. I should say certainly there are people thinking about it. Yes, where what what kind of child are you gonna create? Well, this is the question when you have and this is what I wanted to get to when you have things like CRISPR and you have what could be Legitimate legitimate genetic engineering of fetuses and of embryos legitimate you mean authentic Yeah, it implies it's yeah, I mean like they can sanctioned. I mean not sanctioned But the fact that that is an emerging technology and that like all technologies it will increase in its ability With innovation with new versions, where do you think this goes? Do you think it's inevitable that human beings engineer ourselves into these super creatures that are homogenous? Do you think? I think we, as has almost always been the case, the science is advancing faster than our morality. Yes. Or our sensibilities. Or appreciations of humanity. You know, and often the scientific advance has very important plus sides to it. Here's what I want to see happen. If we can control the genome,  Let's just start with what already exists in nature, all right? We put ourselves at the top of the tree of life. But if newts could draw the tree of life, they put themselves at the top. Why? They can regenerate their limbs. And we can't. They would value that very highly. So would we. Let's get whatever that is in the newt, splice it into us, line up all the veterans who have missing limbs, put them first. Regenerate them. If lobsters can do it, and crabs can do it, and newts can do it. They are doing research on that, correct? I haven't checked it. I believe I read. I would hope so. But we're doing research on  Growing organs. Yes, there's a huge need for that. Yes, you don't have to wait for someone to die, right, right? Particularly the day we have self-driving cars on the road dominating the Population of cars I see that happening within decades by the way and have good reason for thinking that but the day that happens we lose so so no longer do 35,000 people a year die right  Peak physical health which has been a source of so many organs organ donors, right? Yes, you sign your card when you get your driver's license so that when you die in a car accident We can harvest your organs. You're young and all your organs work. We don't hurt harness organs harvest organs of 80 year olds because they're 80 or 90 right right so  The day we lose the 35,000 deaths per year, I hope that happens at a time when we can start growing artificial organs. Have you done any playing around with auto driving features on things like Teslas? I know it's there, but I'm not mentally ready. It's pretty amazing. Jamie and I have the latest beta of Tesla self-driving. Have you messed with it at all, Jamie? Yeah, what's your take? I had someone drive me around with it in the beta. Not comfortable yet, is the best I would say. You keep your hands on the wheel? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, me too. Yeah, yeah. And I haven't had to take over, but there's one time I was like, eh, I'm not doing this right now. I'll test it another time. Here's what I did do in a Tesla. You put it on the... Self-driving? It's not self-driving. Auto? No, just the simple... What's it called? All the old cars had it. Cruise control? Yeah, cruise control. But it's managed cruise control, right? So I put it at 50 miles an hour. The traffic slows to 30. It slows to 30 with a prescribed car distance in front of me. The traffic goes to a standstill, the car stops. The traffic picks up. The old cars wouldn't do that, right? Right. So it's doing this. So I experiment with that. And I noticed that when it starts from a stop,  Or when it slows down, it's way harder on its brakes than I am. Yes. I'm way smoother driver than my cruise control. Yeah. And I've seen cars come in from the side, and it abruptly stops. When I saw it before, it did. And so I don't know. But we're at the beginning. Judgment. It's dawn. It's the dawn of this. But you're recognizing patterns and judgment, and whether or not someone's paying attention, and whether or not it's going to be- All that has to happen is that it goes into an AI learning mode, and it gets the sum of all of these experiences of all drivers in these situations. Yeah, AI is going to kill some people in self-driving mode, but I guarantee you- It's going to kill a lot less. It will kill fewer people than in-  than without it. Have you seen Lex Friedman playing guitar while he's driving around in a self-driving car? Yeah, Lex drove around in a Tesla while playing guitar. Uh-huh, uh-huh. It's pretty fascinating. Right. So there's a headline here. And that I'm going to read to a very simple headline. But where is it here? T-E. Oh my goodness, where is it? There it is. There's Lex. Oh. That's pretty good. Lex can shred. Give me some of that. You gotta listen to this. Listen to this. Oh yeah, he was playing along. Here it goes. Listen to here. Have you done Lex's podcast? You'd love him. He's an AI researcher From MIT originally now. He's mostly doing independent work and doing his own podcast and brilliant brilliant guy You would love him. Mm-hmm, and he's got an amazing podcast, too Okay, so here it's gonna be in this section. You're interested in Lex's podcast Seems like it's not paying attention. What do you mean? I got this  No, thank you for the tip. I'm trying to get him on, buddy. I'm trying to get him in. Lex, actually, is one of the most brilliant people I know. I think you would love talking to him. We have an interesting quote here from Walter Batchot. One of the greatest pains to human nature is the pain of a new idea. Really? That guy's an idiot. That's not the greatest pain. Someone needs to kick him in the nuts. It's human nature. The pain of loss, the pain of failure. There's a lot more pains. Actually, no, the longer quote I have here, just in all fairness to the fellow, is,  It is, as common people say, so upsetting, it makes you think that, after all, your favorite notions may be wrong, your firmest beliefs ill-founded. Naturally therefore common men hate a new idea and art Disposed more or less to ill-treat the original man who brings it. Oh boy now We're in the common man. Okay. All right, that's 19th century. I like that even less. All right. Here's a headline ready. Mm-hmm, and it's why our brain is not statistically prepared a headline, okay  Tesla says autopilots autopilot makes its car safer crash victims say it kills Both of those are true Yeah, but less it's like introducing mountain lions into areas to kill correct. Yeah, both of those are true And if you keep at it, yes, autopilot or AI self-driving will kill people, but that number will drop every single year. And you know why? Because every way that someone dies, no other person will die that way again, because they'll upload all the software, and that does not happen. And this is what the airline industry did. The FAA investigates every single crash. You know why you can't take lithium ions onto a plane? Because it was a UPS plane that had lithium ion batteries in the cargo and it caught fire. And there's the audio of the pilots talking to each other and to the thing while the plane is on fire just before the thing crashes. Do you remember when they used to make you take the batteries out of Samsung phones when you got on planes? I never used a Samsung phone. Samsung phones had an issue one of their their galaxy. No. Oh, yeah, I remember burst into flame I remember they they juiced up the battery capacity. I remember it. Yeah. Yeah, and they Well crazy So all I was always saying is that they fix that now part of the diversity of who and what we are is who? Who you love yeah who what you want to look like you know that this resistance to the gender spectrum Concerns me because it's a it's a force of restriction on people's freedom and somewhere I read that America is like pursuit of happiness. I read that somewhere some document right and so if someone  Wants to dress in whatever way they want and if it doesn't conform with your with your binarity You're going to create a law to prevent them from doing it What what is that does that are we any longer in a free country if you have that power over me?  to express my happiness and Another thing we're not good at And I gotta go like soon how long we've been talking here dude couple hours damn Dude, come on. This is fun, but I love you, man. I love you. I love you, man People don't know we were outside wrestling a few moves I used to wrestle you know Captain of my high school sir. I have a little flashback. Yeah, I  It was the third period. I was down four points. Uh-oh. Yeah, yeah. The buzzer. So, what was I saying? We're talking about diversity. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're talking about- Yeah, yeah. So- This is the concern. Another thing we're bad at,  We're bad at recognizing a spectrum of things when we confront it. Our urge is to categorize it. That urge is so great. We categorize things that are fundamentally not categorizable. For example, hurricane strengths. Hurricane strength is a continuum of miles per hour of wind speed. But we cut it into five categories. And you know what happens? That affects us. So a hurricane, Hurricane Irma, goes from low category three to high category three. They're just, oh, it's just category three, Irma. It goes up one mile an hour, it's breaking news. Hurricane Irma strengthened to category four just this past hour, and everybody crowds around the TV set. So our brain doesn't allow a continuum. We can't, so what happens? Are you a boy or are you a girl? You have to be one of, maybe there's a continuum, okay? Oh, you wanna talk X chromosome, Y chromosome? We can do that, fine. All right, so biogenetically, I can say that there's a boy and a girl or some variant on that, which is in the rare case where you have doubled up on the chromosomes. Intersex. Yeah, intersex. Sure, we can have that conversation, but that's not,  visible to me in what you do when you wake up in the morning. I don't see your chromosomes. You know what I do? I see what you do to make yourself look like a boy. You go to the gym. You'd have wimp muscles if you didn't work out. Okay? That's what you do because you're a boy. You wear boy clothes so that everyone knows you're a boy. If it was that obvious you were a boy, you wouldn't have to do all of that. So, so much of what we do to split us into this binarity is artificially added on top of the chromosomes. So, like I said, if you're a wimpy guy and you go wear man's clothes and you go to the gym because you want to look like a boy. If you're a girl, you're a woman and you have hair on your lip, can't have a mustache, you're a girl. Got hair between your eyebrows, can't have that, got to remove that. Okay, your breasts are not large enough get them enlarged as what happens to what is the number? 300,000 breast augmentations a year in the United States. Okay. These are huge numbers to make us look more to fit into this binarity and suppose I don't buy into that binarity I say I Like the spectrum someday. I feel a little feminine. Sometimes I feel I don't gonna wear clothes that way You're gonna come after me and say I don't like that. I'm gonna pass a law on  Oh my gosh, that's no longer a free country. Is anybody saying that you should pass a law that men can't wear whatever they want or women can't wear whatever they want? There are forces of resistance in society that are strongly preventing it. Yes. Well, I think that's unfortunate, but by the way some solutions like which bathroom do you use yeah solutions there? Yeah, just make unisex bathrooms Yeah, every new restaurant in New York City is that so that takes an entire category? Yeah, those worries and concerns off the table when we're talking about genetic engineering by the way. That's in the chapter I  Gender and an identity and I didn't even get to Color and race. Oh my gosh, just before I go. I want to read a quick thing from that section. We're going good No, no, no, no finish. What's your point? Mike my wonder is like we're if you try to look at what human beings are capable of doing now in terms of genetic engineering and What the hopes are where do you think this leads us if this is allowed? It's not good  Whether or not it's going to be allowed. It's going to happen. Where do you think this leads us to? Do you think this lead when you look at this is when you look at the archetypal? Alien, what is it? It's got a large head and this no sex organs and they never have hair. I want a hairy alien one day hairy with a hairdo, right? Yeah, right. They're always bald big eyes 70 afro. Yeah. Yeah. What what do you think that leads us to do you think that leads us to like one uniform shape or Do you think it leads us to everyone looking like Thor like where does that lead us to? Yeah, but of course Thor still had to go to the gym. But what if there comes a point in time where that's not necessary? Sorry, the actor who plays Thor still had to go to the gym. Right, with things like biostatin inhibitors. You aware of those? Yeah, I am. Yeah. So if they incorporate that into the human genome, then you're going to have people that have incredible amounts of muscle mass, and they don't even have to do anything to achieve it. But what you would have done was, as a parent or as someone in control, predetermine  What they can or should be in life, whereas in a free world, in a free society, a person's own ambitions should be what guides them, in my opinion. And I don't think that's a controversial opinion. Certainly. I agree with you. But my concern is, if the technology gets to the point where it's a uniform strategy,  And that people just start doing that to their children. We're talking 100 years from now, 1,000 years from now? Oh, way sooner than that. 50 years, easily. Where does this go? Easily 50 years. Yeah, so you want to have the muscle-bound family? But suppose one of them wanted to be a ballet dancer and had to be a little more lanky and elegant. What if we get to a point where genetic engineering could be utilized on fully formed adults? And you could change the shape of, like, you know, there's people that are transgender. What if you could literally become a double X chromosome human being? And you will literally have a vagina, literally have breasts, ovulate, have a womb. I don't know how that would, I have to think about how that would happen. That would be like an extreme limit of controlling your genomes. Yeah, so that's a really interesting different world. It means you can be whoever you want. Right. That's what we are on Halloween, right? Thoughts on human neural interfaces like things like Neuralink and these technologies that are being proposed that would allow human beings to integrate with technology in a physical way symbiotically Yeah, so I have a chapter in here called Called exploration and discovery where we talk about the rapid pace of  Technology and its impact on civilization, which is extraordinary but I  Most predictions are wrong You get it right in the first few years and after a few decades with new technology new possibilities emerged that couldn't even It comes in from the side. Yeah, rather than like the Internet more of what correct correct. It reminds me of There was an ad in 1992 193 early 90s from AT&T they had a relatively successful ad campaign where they said  Have you ever wanted to body daddy daddy daddy not and they say some futuristic thing and they say you will AT&T will bring it to you. Yeah, I've seen that one of the things one of the commercials was something I've never wanted to do never dreamed of doing never did and never will do They show a guy on a beach Okay, and he's working on a tablet, which was a good predictive thing tablets did come. He's we're gonna tell me said oh  Have you, and there's a surf coming in, it was a beautiful beach scene, he said, have you ever wanted to send a fax from the beach? Well, you will, AT&T. I was like, no, thank you. No one has ever in the history of the universe wanted to do that. But why wouldn't they if that was all that existed? I'm just saying. But now it's email. It's the same thing. It's email attachment, correct. Sure. But you don't see that coming if you're extolling the virtues of faxes. Right. That's like in Back to the Future Part Two. Film made in 1989. We're riding high in faxes the 89 to the early 90s You know what year that took place was supposed to take place back the future to it's like modern. Yeah 2015 yeah, okay, so Marty pisses off his boss, and he gets fired. Yeah, all right, so the boss communicates this  via fax to his residence. Except this is the residence of the future. He has three fax machines in his home. So you see them, they come out on three different fax machines. And no matter what room he was in, he would see it. Because that's the home of the future. Because a modern home in 1989 with one fax machine, many homes had no fax machines. So this is how, we're linear thinking people. Here's Marty. You're fired. There, there. Three different facts. Four facts machines. That's the future. There it is. That's what they thought. Isn't that funny? Oh, no. The future. Wild. And so I talk about here how we also have linear brains, which prevents us from seeing exponential change. Yes. And the best example of this is Algaeana Pond. Okay, so algae, you know, as it grows and it floats on the pond, you see like one square foot of it and you learn. Someone tells you the algae is doubling every day and you have this huge pond and you're told this, okay? You go away for a month and come back, the pond is half covered with algae. You say, oh my gosh, I was away for a month and this happened. When will it be completely covered? So what's the answer? It took a month to get halfway. So how much more time? A week? No, a day. What did I say? Doubles. It doubles every day. Yes. That's how I started this conversation. Yes. See, the linear brain overrides even the stated facts. And you know how they deal with that? They introduce CARP. Good, I didn't know that the carp eat all the algae. I didn't know that yeah But then the problem is they eat all the out all the vegetation and you get like Lake Austin Oh, there's almost no vegetation and all the bass have no place to hide. Yeah interesting. Yeah, Lake Austin looks like the bottom of a swimming pool now  Interesting. Yeah, it's a mistake. Nothing there. Whoops. Yeah. You think you know all the causes and effects of things, and then you don't. Well, when I was on the Big Island, I found out about mongooses. Big Island Hawaii, yeah. Yeah. When I was there for the King of Zootopia. Can we call them mongoose? Is that allowed? They're so adorable. We saw one at the resort, a mongoose. Cute little fellow. But Hawaii has no snakes. So what do the mongoose eat? Unfortunately, they brought them in for rats, and they went after ground nesting birds. And so they've devastated local wildlife. There it is. When you're an island in the middle of the Pacific, that stuff is pretty tightly configured. Those little fellas are so cute. Okay, the mongooses found in Hawaii are native to India. We were introduced to Hawaiian islands in 1883 by the sugar industry to control rats and sugarcane fields. Any species in Hawaii is going to be invasive. Yes. But then it gets to a point where people are making the argument that wild pigs are no longer invasive because they've been there as long as the humans have. Yeah. So it's only a problem when it's a problem. Yeah. That's really what that comes down to. Right. Right. Right. I'm told that L.A.  palm trees are not native. Right. They're not. Yeah. But they do really well there. And they haven't overrun the city or anything. Also they're like symbolic of Los Angeles. The palm tree. Yeah. You got it. They're everywhere. OK, so I make a prediction by the year 250. I have a bunch of predictions here. OK, let's hear it. And this is so that in 2050, you can say, Tyson, you had your head up your ass, OK? I have no hesitation, because I go through a whole set of predictions that all didn't come out right, people predicting 30 years ahead. And so I just want to join the susceptibility parade here. OK, maybe you'll nail a few. Neuroscience and our understanding of the human mind will become so advanced that mental illness will be cured, leaving psychologists and psychiatrists without jobs. In a shift that echoes the rapid conversion from horses to automobiles in the early 20th century, self-driving electric vehicles will fully replace all cars and trucks on the road. If you want to be nostalgic with your fancy combustion engine sports car, you can drive on specially designed tracks akin to horse riding stables of today. Very nostalgic. The human space program will fully transition to a space industry supported not by tax dollars, but by tourism and anything else people dream of doing in space. We develop a perfect antiviral serum and cure cancer. Medicines will tailor to your own DNA, leaving no adverse side effects. And this is in response to your earlier question. We will resist the urge to merge the circuitry of computers with the circuitry of our brains. Have you ever seen the statistics? I'm happy enough to just dig it up here. No, I don't need to surgically implant this. I'm seconds away from all the knowledge of the world that I could possibly want. I don't have to surgically implant it. I don't have that urge. I'm sorry. Right. But if they do increase the capacity for human knowledge and your access to information substantially to the point where someone with a neural interface has an enormous advantage over anybody who doesn't. Well, they'll do it faster, perhaps. But not just faster, but change the way you interface with  Information that remains to be seen and of course our guy says that yeah, mr.. Singularity no no well Ray Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil Yeah, right. He's a big fan of that is a new book where it's  The singularity is nearer. His first book was The Singularity Was Near. What a prediction. We will learn how to regrow lost limbs and failing organs, bringing us up to the level of other regenerating animals on Earth, like salamanders, starfish, and lobsters. Hmm instead of becoming our overlord and enslaving us all Artificial intelligence will be just another helpful feature of the tech infrastructures that serve our daily lives Those are my predictions to be found wrong. Do you have any fears of artificial general intelligence? No, I  Not at all? I don't think that's where it's gonna head. Neither does Kurzweil, by the way. I think we'll put intelligence in things that need to do things. Get the perfect cup of coffee. Put it in your car so it drives and doesn't get in an accident. Put it in things. To have the one thing that does it all, I don't... I would love to hear you talk to Elon about this, because he has a deep fear of it. Yeah, I'm anomalous there, so don't listen to me, listen to others. You're anomalous in the fact that you're not concerned Yes, if you go to AI experts, most of them are concerned that it poses an existential threat I think it'll just be more stuff that'll help us out. But what about when it's used in military applications? Well, that is an ethical I mean all military operations involve some ethical  Decision tree right so it would be added to the ethical decision, but when you have Unethical foreign countries that will use these sort of little bit tank anti-tank warfare, so you need ways to combat that Once ministers of AI we don't yeah, we're behind on that curve. I'm worried I Yeah, that's the concern right the concern is that someone else is going to implement it Yeah, and they're not going to have ethics or morals behind it They're just gonna have this idea of control and dominance correct, and so there's always the bad actor. Yeah, you've got a And the military they're paid to consider and the real concern conduct of a bad actor is that we become them to beat them and  That's the fear. Yeah. It's like we're not autocratic, or we don't think we are. So we would have to get an entire Congress, an entire electorate  Vote that way. Yeah, and that's If we do, I don't know what the future of the world will be at that point. It's spooky It's spooky because again that we don't have the ability to sort of extrapolate and look at the future in terms of like how all these things are implemented and what the overall Results gonna be So you're not worried about these human neural interfaces at all. You don't you don't see that happening You don't see it happening at all. No, I think we'll resist it I don't I think it'll but didn't we there's a lot of people that resisted email like I don't even have email man Those people all got on board. Yeah Remember that and they print it and then read the printed email, you know Yeah, but a lot of people resisted this idea of cell phones, but now they're everywhere. No, of course. No, the only resistance I'm referring about is the machine biology interface, right? That's what we're gonna resist. We're not gonna resist the continued advance of the technology. But if it creates a superior human being. It already has. It beats us at chess, at Go, at any intellectual task we give it. It's already superior. But I mean if it's a symbiotic thing, if it becomes integrated with the human biology. I think we'll resist that, that's all. It's a prediction. I think you will. I'm going to hop on board right away. I'm going to be one of the first people. I'm going to drill a hole in my head, Elon. Let's go. The cyborg implanted. I don't want to be left behind. Well, the real concern is that it's really going to separate the haves from the have-nots, because if it does give you an advantage economically, an advantage in terms of your intellectual capacity,  You're going to have this advantage because it's going to be prohibitively expensive. I would assume initially often things that are prohibitively expensive initially Don't forever stay that right like cell phones, of course, but eventually it becomes flat panel TVs. Sure. Do you like impulse items at Kmart? I was just at Walmart 50-inch TV nuts. Yes, it's nuts It's crazy. They were so expensive. I remember. And heavy. Like 20 grand. Yes. Tens of thousands of dollars. And they'd come in like wood crates. You needed power tools to undo it. You can do it yourself and mount them yourself on the wall. Let me leave you with some thoughts here. Okay. Please do. There's a section here on race and color. which is another thing with the variation of what we have in the world. Just a point I wanna make, when European anthropologists started running through Africa and started describing what they saw, their urge was to say, everyone in Africa is this thing, and they have dark skin, wooly hair, and that is a thing. And they called it a race, and they called it the Negroes, okay? And this is our attempt to classify  into few categories, something that might actually in real life be on a spectrum. We know that the human species began in Africa and everybody who populates everywhere else in the world came out of Africa to do that. What that tells you is that the genetic diversity within Africa as the origin of our species  is greater than it is between any other two people anywhere else in the world. But because the anthropologists were not thinking genetic diversity, they're thinking skin color. They put them all in one bin. But if you have the most genetic diversity, then in practically every way humans vary, you would find the extreme of that in the African continent. Where would you find the tallest people in the world? Watusi tribe of Africa. How about the shortest people in the world? Pygmies. The Pygmies. Not even that far away. Right. Geographically. They have the same skin color, so the Europeans said these are one group of people, one race. Where might you find the slowest people in the world? Well, no one looks for them. Where would you find, there's no races to find the slowest people. How about the fastest people? Africa. Okay? People of African descent have dominated the long distance as well as the sprint. Two completely different physical abilities. Oh, but they're all dark skinned people, they're all Negroes. Okay? Where would you likely find the dumbest person in the world?  Africa. How about the smartest person in the world? Africa. How about the Egyptians? The Europeans did not look for people smarter than they were. OK. And to this day, where they find evidence where that might have been the case, you have people saying aliens did it. Egypt is, of course, in Africa. Yeah. Brilliant civilization. Oh my gosh while Europeans were still either disemboweling heretics or whatever the hell they were doing I was like even before that thousands of years ago so my point is if you don't look for it, and you don't find it and you're gonna create a map of Humans of the world you're gonna put yourself at the top that's what you're gonna do and you're gonna write things and  Like this. Who do you want to hear from? Thomas Jefferson or Francis Galton? Jefferson. Jefferson. 1785. Speaking of the Negroes. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me that in memory they are equal to the whites. in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid. And in imagination, they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous. What is Euclid? I honestly don't know how many Euclid-fluent white people Jefferson knew in the original American colonies. Euclid invented geometry. Okay, Euclidean geometry is ancient Greece. And his books still exist to this day. So he's saying the black slaves don't know Euclid, can't figure out Euclid. Well, they haven't been educated. Regardless, how many white farmers in 1785 USA also knew Euclid? Yeah. No.  Zero. Okay. Okay. But whatever were his observations and objections to black people, he had no hesitation continually mating with at least one of them, producing six children. So, you know what I did here? Oh, then there's a guy who wrote a whole book comparing black people and white people, a book that was used into the 1960s. It was called The Origin of Races by Carlton Kuhn. He wrote, if Africa was the cradle of mankind, which he recognizes, it was only an indifferent kindergarten. Europe and Asia were our principal schools. So this is these are people putting themselves at the top He's white. So he's got to put white people at the top then I thought suppose anthropologists Were black racists instead of white racists What were they right? What would they come up with? Well also what he's saying is ridiculous because if it's kindergarten, how did they do the pyramids? Oh  It's the most complex structures ever known to man. Hold on. We can't reproduce today? All of us. My only point is when you have that mindset and you have to put yourself at the top and all people with dark skin are one entity, you're not looking for people smarter than you. You're not. There's other evidence here. Do you realize that the people who get the highest scores on standardized tests in England are people, immigrants from the Igbo tribe in Nigeria? And their kids outscore all the, quote, native white people in the town. If you're not looking for them, you're not finding them. It just doesn't, it's a thing. It's all here in this chapter. And all I'm doing is bringing science to it. That's all I'm doing here. Where is it here? Okay. So, black, yeah. Here it goes. Then I gotta go. I can't keep staying here, dude. It's okay. You can come back. There's a lot of little stickies on that book. I'm sure you have many other things to talk about. What is the book, by the way? Oh.  Starry Messenger. Cosmic perspectives. Is it out currently? Civilization. Came out eight weeks ago. Please tell me you did the audio version of it. I did. Thank you. I did. I hate when people have other people do the audio version. Oh yeah. I did the audio version. I'm glad. Oh yeah. Of course you, you'd have to. I could not do the audio version of this. How? Some fucking actor? I talk about the pyramids here. Even Elon Musk, by the way, tweeted,  pyramids Aliens built the pyramids obviously that's Elon said he was joking around well possibly, but he said it and it's in a You know Elon likes to joke around about shit Here's one on May 1st 2021 a talented chess player reached the title of national master for having achieved a US Chess Federation rating above 2200 landing among the top 4% of 350,000 rated players in the world  A rating achieved that was 500 points higher than that of his chess coach, just a few years after learning how to play the game. That prodigy is a 10-year-old boy named Tanitoluwa Aduan. Adewumi, the son of Nigerian refugees to the USA in 2017. His family spent a brief time living in homeless shelters in New York City before his parents established stable employment and permanent residence. I played a brief chess game against the little fellow in March 2021 on Grandmaster Maurice Ashley's Twitch platform. A live-streaming social media interface. The game was, indeed, brief. Yeah, he wiped the floor with me. Speaking of Nigerians, immigrants to the US enjoy an 8% higher household income than the national average. Nigerian immigrants to the United States. And ethnic Nigerian children in the United Kingdom, especially those from the Igbo tribe, consistently attain higher test scores on average than their white UK counterparts. What is it about Nigeria? Because so many brilliant people come from Nigeria. These are occasions to pause. What depths of intellectual capital in math, science, and engineering, or any field, lay hidden deep within the African continent?  or anywhere else on earth, lost for now or lost forever for want of an opportunity to flourish. I'm gonna leave you with a fast list. I wanna tell you what my racist black anthropologist found. Let's go back to the 19th century. Let all anthropologists be black racists instead of white racists, okay? What would they say? So, all right. Chimpanzees are humans' closest genetic relative. We just need to find similarities between chimps and white people, and that would be surefire evidence of their less evolved state. Because that's what people were saying. The blacks were still evolving. And they show a chimp, a black person, and a white person. And so that's, you can enslave black people and laws against them. Way to justify it. Because of course you're gonna put yourself at the top. So now, hypothetical black racist anthropologist. Chimps and other apes, so this is a list. This is in a book that was never written. Chimps and other apes grow hair all over their bodies. The hairiest people you've ever seen have been white people with mats of hair across their chests and ascending their backs. Their body hair can even reach upward and out of their shirt collar. Black people do not remotely approximate this level of hairiness. There was no mention of this in any of those books. Distinct from their face, hands and feet, part the hair of most chimpanzees, the way they do to each other when checking for lice, and their skin color is white, not any shade of black or brown. Chimps tend to have big ears relative to their head size. After decades of ear watching, I can attest that the biggest ears I've ever seen on humans have been on white people. Have a look yourself next time you're in a crowded public place. Doubtless there's strong overlap, but the size of black people's ears can be as little as half the size of white people's ears. You might now ask about the famously large ears of President Barack Obama. But he is precisely half white, just as much white as black. So maybe his big ears come from the white half of his family. For most of the 20th century, Neanderthals were portrayed as stupid and brutish. Turns out, beginning in the 1990s, genetic research revealed that Europeans are between 1% and 3% Neanderthal. Africans, zero percent. That can't be good for Europeans. Time to clean up that backward primitive image. Since then, published references to Neanderthals instead comment on what must have been their creative, artistic, inventive, and articulate ways, crafting sophisticated tools and technologies to shape their world. Look how easy it is to be racist. Let's continue. Chimpanzees invest quality family time pruning each other's hair. We've all watched them do this. Apparently, the lice they find must be tasty, because whoever plucks them from the other chimp's head also eats them. Ever hear of a lice outbreak among black children? Probably not. White children are 30 times more susceptible to lice infestation than are black children. The parasite simply likes to lay eggs in the hair of chimpanzees and white people more than on the hair of black people. This goes on. This could have been included and they would have said, well wait a minute, maybe all humans are together and chimps are something completely different. But they didn't go there. Their bias prevented their analysis of information that stares flat into their face, okay? Here's one. I'm gonna skip some here, because I gotta go. I got a plane waiting for me. I'm skipping some here. Ready? This is one more from the chimp vault. I have others that are not chimp related. Here's one. Chimpanzees love to swing in trees. Apparently, so do suburban white children. They typically can't wait to build and live in a backyard tree house. You have not likely seen black children even contemplate the idea. The white people clearly want to return to their fully primitive state. This would be a racist black person, okay, from the 19th century, publishing, trying to find ways to enslave white people. That's a cosmic perspective. That's a, look, dude, this is what we were doing as humans to each other. Not recognizing authentic diversity in who and what we are. Trying to separate, to say, I'm better, I make the rules, and whatever rule I'm making, I'm gonna put myself at the top. And you're not gonna be at the top, because you're different. Do you anticipate that as people get more education, more information, and as we evolve, that we'll stop doing that and we'll start recognizing the importance of diversity? I want to believe that. And that it's our strength? I want to believe that. I want to believe that, too. I so want to believe that. OK. Here it is. Then I really got to go. OK. Last one. This is a quote, a short quote from Horace Mann, 200 years ago. I want this on my tombstone. I beseech you, nobody uses beseech anymore, I love it. I beseech you to treasure up in your hearts these, my parting words. Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity. Hmm. Our primal urge to keep looking up is surely greater than our primal urge to keep killing one another. If so, then human curiosity and wonder, the twin chariots of cosmic discovery, will ensure that starry messages, these are messages from science, from the sky, from the universe, continue to arrive. These insights compel us, for our short time on Earth, to become better shepherds of our own civilization. Yes, life is better than death. Life is also better than having never been born. But each of us is alive against stupendous odds. We won the lottery only once. We get to invoke our faculties of reason to figure out how the world works. But we also get to smell the flowers. We get to bask in divine sunsets and sunrises.  and gaze deeply into the night sky they cradle. We get to live and ultimately die in this glorious universe. That's a hell of a tombstone. Dude, I gotta run. Thanks, sir. One day I'll come back and just chill. We'll lift weights together. Okay. Wrestle a few rounds. Let's do it. You know. Thank you very much. Appreciate you.

Here we go, Gabe. Great to see you, and congratulations. Thank you. You will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born. You will know for the rest of this child's life you were born during a weird time. That's for sure. That is for sure, probably the weirdest that I can remember. Yeah, yeah, and he was born on May the 4th. And that's Lares too. Yeah. May the 4th be with him. Yes, exactly. Has to be. May the 4th be with him. Yes, exactly. Has to be. I sure hope so. Perfect. Yes. I mean, that was the perfect day for you. I'm, yeah. And then, how do you say the name? Well, uh... Is it a placeholder? And first of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name. Is it a place? Congratulations to her. Yeah, yeah, she's great at names. So, I mean, it's just X, the letter X. And then, the A-E is pronounced Ash. Yeah, go, Jay. Yeah, and then A-12 is my contribution. Why A-12? Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR-71, coolest plane ever. True. I agree with you. I don't know, I'm not familiar with it. I know what the SR-71 is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what that is. So what? Yeah, I know what that is, but... So, the SR-71 came from a CIA program called Archangel. It's the Archangel Project. And then Archangel 12... Oh, wow, what a dope looking plane. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Yeah. Well as a person who's very much into Aerial travel as you are that's a perfect. It's pretty great. Yeah, pretty great So is it does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going does it feel like you've had Children before is this any weirder? It's actually I think it's better Being older and having a kid. I appreciate it more Hmm. Yeah, baby's awesome. Yeah When I didn't have my any of my own I would see other people's kids and I didn't not like them sure but I wasn't drawn to them Sure, but now when I see little people's kids I'm like oh I think of them like these little love packages Yeah, little love books Yeah It's just you you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you Like your whole idea what a baby is is very different. Yeah Yeah. So now as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult, it must be really pretty wonderful. Yeah. Wonderful. It's great. Babies are awesome. They are. Yeah. That's great. They are. Yeah. I mean, also, I've spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets. And so you can sort of see the kind of the brain develop, which is an AI neural net that is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. And you can sort of see the learning very quickly. You know, it's just, wow. See things fire. So you're talking about the neural net. You're not talking about an actual baby. I'm talking about an actual baby. But both of them. Yes. But the word neural net comes from the brain. It's like a net of neurons. So it's like the humans are the original gangster neural net. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. So when you are programming artificial intelligence, where you're working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain? Yeah. In a lot of ways. There's some ways that are different. An analogy that's often used is like, we don't make a submarine swim like a fish. But we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to a submarine. I've always wondered, as a layperson, do you try to achieve the same results as a human brain, but through different methods, or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results? The essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. Neural net. Having the multiple layers of neurons and back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition. And then it'll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It's interesting, very interesting. I would imagine the thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us, that one day it's going to be like, why did you do it that way? When artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they're like, oh, you tried to mimic yourself. So much better process cut out all this nonsense. Like I said, there are elements that are the same. And just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird, it doesn't flap its wings. But the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as bird. Now you're in the middle of this strange time where you're selling your houses, you say you don't want any material possessions and I've been seeing all that and I've been really excited to talk to you about this because it's an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Why are you doing that? Yeah. I'm slightly sad about it actually. If you're sad about it, why are you doing it? I think possessions kind of weigh you down. They're kind of an attack vector. People say, hey, billionaire, you got all this stuff. Well, now I know stuff, now what are you going to do? Attack vector meaning people target it. Interesting, yeah. But you're obviously going to, so you're going to rent a place? Yeah. Okay. And get rid of everything, sub-close? And get rid of everything, sub-close? No, I said almost everything. Keep a couple Teslas. Teslas, kind of have to, test product and stuff. The things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those here. It was kind of have to. Yeah. What's the worst thing that happened? I mean, you're fine. Yeah, you could always buy more stuff if you don't like it. I suppose so. Yeah, I mean, from the money that you sell all your stuff, you could buy new stuff. I suppose so. people define you by the fact that you're wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way? For sure, I mean, not everyone, but there's, for sure, in recent years, billionaire has become a pejorative, like it's a pejorative. It's like that's a bad thing, which I think doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases. If you've done, if you basically organized a company, so how does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before, and you have some ownership in that company, then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital. So there's a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. So let me say Warren Buffett, for example, and to be totally frank, I'm not his biggest fan, but he does a lot of capital allocation, and he reads a lot of sort of annual reports of companies, and we'll be counting, and it's pretty boring, really. And he's trying to figure out is, does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean, that's, I mean, it's kind of a boring job, if you ask me, but it's still a thing that's important to figure out, like which is a company deserving of more or less capital? Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital, and if it's not, it should get less. We'll go out of business. Well, there's a big difference too between someone who's making an incredible amount of money, designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who's making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around the stock market or doing things along those lines. It's a different thing, and to put them all in the same category seems, it's very simple. And as you pointed out, it's an attack vector. It's a different thing. And to put them all- I mean I think it's really, I do think in the United States especially there's an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically too many smart people go into finance and law. So this is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have I think fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it's often looked down upon which I think is wrong. Yeah. Well I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China that there's a lot of value into making things and to making things here. Yes. Somebody's got to do the real work. Yeah. You know and you know like making a car it's an honest day's loving that's for sure you know or making anything really or providing a valuable service like providing you know good entertainment, good information that these are all valuable things to do. You know so yeah it should be more of it. Yeah. Do you have a moment where is just something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realized that. Yeah I've been thinking about it for a while. You know a part of it is like I like have a bunch of houses but I don't spend a lot of time in most of them and that doesn't seem like a good use of assets. Like somebody could probably be in front of those houses and get better use of them than me so. Don't you have Gene Wilder's house? I do. That's amazing. It's awesome. Wow. I do. That's amazing. It's awesome. Wow. Exactly what you'd expect. Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up? Yeah, that's a requirement. Oh, a requirement? That's a good requirement? Yeah. In that case. In that house. Yeah. It'll probably sell for less, but still don't care. He's a legend. He'd want his soul. Yeah. He'd want his essence. Yeah. In the building. He's also. And it's there. It's a real quick. Is it quirky house? Yeah, is it quirky house? Yeah What what makes you say it's there? Like what do you get out of it? I mean all the all the cabinets are like can't handmade and they're like odd shapes and there's like doors to nowhere and strange like car doors and tunnels and odd odd paintings on the wall and Yeah, did you ever live in it? It's very quirky. I I did live in it briefly. Yeah, really? Yeah, but why do you buy houses? Like if you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go? I think I'd like to have that. Well, I you know had one house and then the June Wilder house right across the road from me from from my main house and it was gonna get it was gonna get sold and then torn down and turn into you know be a big construction zone for three years and I was like, well, I think I'll buy it and preserve the spirit of June Wilder and not have a giant construction zone and then the you know this I started having like some privacy issues where like people would like let's people just like come to my house and You know start climbing over the walls and stuff like man So then I said like what a house some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point well You know, it'd be cool to to build a house. So then I said acquired some properties at the top of Samara Road and which is Got a great view and it's like okay. Well these some bunch of sort of small older houses. They're gonna get torn down anyway I was like, well, you know, if I collect these like little little houses then I can build something You know, I don't know artistic like a you know dream house type of thing What's a dream house for Elon Musk like some Tony Stark type shit? Yeah, definitely Yeah, you got to have the the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know Yeah, for sure. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah, but but then I was like man Do I really want it doesn't really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I'd be real you know get a like OCD on the little details and the design and Or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter So yeah, you know, like what's more important Mars or a house? I like Mars Okay, is that really how you think like that? It'd be better off Planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean The you can only do so many things right, right? So how you know, I don't know how you do what you do Anyway, I don't I don't understand how you can run both with a boring company Tesla SpaceX all these different things you're doing constantly I just I don't understand I mean you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is insane I still don't the the productivity is Baffling just doesn't make sense how you can get so much done. Well, I think I do have high productivity but even with that there's still some opportunity cost of time and Allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house Still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, like the the most amount of like brain cycles You know boring company does not take you know, it's like less than 1% of rain cycles and And then this neural link, which is I don't maybe it's like 5% And then 5% that's a good chunk. It's a good chunk. Yeah, that's a good chunk. It's a good chunk Yeah, we were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live when it's Actually going to be available a testing on people right now. No, we're not testing people yet. But I I think it won't be too long, I think we may be able to implant a neural link in Less than a year In a person I think and when you do this Is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this? To see what percentage of people's bodies are going to reject these things? Is it put is it there is there a potential for rejection? It's a very low potential for rejection. I mean you can think of it like people put in you know heart monitors and You know things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation Obviously like, you know, artificial hips and right knees and that kind of thing. So the Probability of I mean like it's so it's well known like what will cause rejection what what will not It's definitely hotter when you've got something that is Sort of reading and writing neurons that's that's generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That's that's a little hotter Then it then it then say passive device, but it's still you know, very doable and Yeah, there there are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now. Yeah, what kind of devices? I would like to deep brain stimulation is fighting for Parkinson's is has Really changed people's lives in a big way Which is kind of remarkable because we're it kind of like zaps your brain it's like kicking the TV type of thing You think like man kicking the TV shouldn't work Yeah, yeah the old old TVs I did my grandpa used to slap the top. Yeah. Yeah the old old TVs it did for sure Yeah, yeah, it would work sometimes. Yeah, so there's deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain that Have changed people's lives for the better like fundamentally Let's talk about what you can talk about to what neural link is because the last time you were here I really couldn't discuss it and then there was a I guess a press release something that sort of Yeah, that that happened quite a bit after the last time you were here. So what exactly is it? How do you do? What what happens if someone ultimately does get a neural link installed? What will take place? Yeah, well for version one of the device it would be basically implanted in your skull, so But it would be Flushed with your skull. So you basically Take out a chunk of skull replace put the neural link device in there you put the the electrode you'd insert the electrode threads very carefully into the the brain and and then you You know stitch it up and and you wouldn't even know that somebody has And then and so then it it can interface basically anywhere Anywhere in your brain so it could be something that you know helps cure say I site like give you returns your eyesight, even if you've like lust your optic nerve type of thing Okay, really? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely hearing obviously. Um, I Mean pretty much anything that where that it could in principle fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain and it could restore limb functionality, so if you've got a interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that's say That's like a microcontroller in near muscle groups you could then create a Sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who's a quadriplegic to full Functionality like they can walk around be normal. Really? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Whoa. Yeah, so maybe slightly better slightly better over time. Yes, you mean with future iterations relations like the you know, six million dollar man, although these days that would Yeah, although these days that would that doesn't that's pretty much. Yeah Six billion dollar man. So the the hole would be small How big would the whole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece? It's only one hole well Yeah, the device we're working on right now is about it's about an inch in diameter And your skulls pretty thick by the way, so skulls are minus for sure. It might actually literally be I mean if you're a big if you're a big guy your skull is actually fairly thick Skulls like it's like seven to fourteen millimeters So probably couple inches a half inch, you know half inch thick skull ish. So Yeah, so that that's a fair bit of like our we got quite a coconut going on. It's not it's not like some eggshell Oh, yeah, I believe you so the Yeah, you basically Implant the device and so you would be like a one inch square One inch in diameter. Yeah, like so an inch circle like a circular One. Yeah, like so. Yeah, I think like a like a smartwatch or something or Okay, yeah Okay, so you take okay. So you take this one inch down in it Like ice fishing right? Here we go ice fishing. I'm no but I'd like to it's great. Yeah, it's really fun Yeah, so it's great. Yeah, it's really fun. Yeah, so you basically take an auger and you You drill it too through the surface of the ice Yeah and you create a small hole. Yeah, you can dunk your line in there So this is like that your ice fishing on the top of your skull and then you cork it real Yeah, and you replace that, say, one-inch diameter piece of skull with this neural length device. And that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger. And then you also get to insert the electrodes. So the electrodes are very carefully inserted with a robot that we developed that's very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries. So it doesn't create trauma. So through this one-inch diameter device, electrodes be inserted and they will find their way. Tiny wires, basically. Tiny wires. Tiny wires. And they'll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate? This tiny wires, basically. Tiny wires. Tiny wires. No, you literally put them where they're supposed to go. Oh, OK. Yeah. You should insert them. How long will these wires be? Yeah, you should insert them \u2013 usually go in like you know depending on where it is like you get two or three millimeters. So they just find the spots. Yeah and then yeah you put the device in and that that gets that that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out and then you stitch up the hole and you have to step it like a little scar and that's it. Well this would be replaceable or reversible Yes, like if someone can't take it anymore. I'm too smart. I can't take it anymore. I'm too smart. I can't take it Yeah, you can totally take it on and what is the besides? Restoring limb function and eyesight in hearing which are all amazing. Is there there any cognitive benefits that you anticipate from something like this? Yeah, I mean you could for sure I mean basically It's a generalized sort of Think for for fixing any kind of brain injury in principle Like if you or if you've got like severe epilepsy or something like that It could it could just it could just sort of stop the episode epilepsy from occurring like it could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy If I Mean there's a whole range of brain injuries like people somebody gets a stroke. They could lose the ability to speak And that that also that could also be fixed So she got like stroke damage or you lose say You know muscle control over part of your face or something like that I think you and then when you get old you tend to if you get like, you know Alzheimer's or something like that then you Lose memory and this could help you with You know restoring your memory like a thing we're storing memory and what what is happening happening that's allowing it to do that like the wires these these small wires you know stimulating these areas of the brain and then is it that the areas of the brain or they're they're losing some sort of electrical force like what what is happening yeah yeah it's like it's like the thing of it's like a bunch of circuits and there's some like circuits that are broken and we can like uh fix those circuits substitute for those circuits And so a specific frequency will go through this? Yeah, it just says. Specific in that, is the process figuring out how much or how little has to be, how much these areas of the brain have to be juiced up? Yeah, it just says. Yeah, I mean, there's still a lot of work to do. So when I say, you know, we got a shot at probably putting in a person in, you know, within a year, I think that's exactly what I mean. I think we have a chance of putting in someone and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they've lost. The fear is that eventually you're gonna have to cut the whole top of someone's head off and put a new top with a whole bunch of wires if you wanna get with, you know, the real turbocharged version, the P100D of brain stimulation. I mean, ultimately, if you wanna go with full AI symbiosis, you'll probably wanna do something like that. Symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to AI. It's optional. I would hope so. Yeah. It's just, I mean, once you enjoy the Dr. Manhattan lifestyle, once you become a god, seems very, very unlikely, you're gonna wanna go back to being stupid again. I mean, you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other. Yeah. Yes. Yes. You wouldn't need to talk. I'm so scared of that, but so excited about it at the same time. Is that weird? Yeah, I mean, I think this is one of the paths to, you know, like, think like, what are the, like, AI is getting better and better. So, now let's assume it's sort of like a benign AI scenario. Even in a benign scenario, we're kinda left behind. You know, we're not along for the ride. We're just too dumb. Right. So, how do you go along for the ride? Right. Yeah, so you can't beat him, join him. So, and we're already a cyborg to some degree, right? Because you've got your phone, you've got your laptop. Glasses. Yeah, yeah, you can do it. You know, electronic devices. Yeah. And, I mean, today, if you don't bring your phone along, it's like you have Messing-Lem syndrome. That's like, you know, feels like something's really, really missing. So, we're already partly... Glasses. Yeah, yeah, good job. You know, electronic devices. You know, partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially. It's just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. So, especially output. Like, you're just going with your thumbs. I mean, like, what's your data rate? Maybe, optimistically, 100 bits per second. That's being generous. And now the computer can communicate at like, you know, 100 terabits. So, certainly, you know, gigabits are a travail at this point. So, this is like, you know, basically, your computer could do things a million times faster. Or, at a certain point, it's like, the AI is like, token or a tree. Okay, it's just boring. You can talk to a tree. It's not very entertaining. So, if you can solve the data rate issue and especially output, but input two, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine. So, you can improve it in what... When you said you won't have to talk to each other anymore, we used to joke around about that. I've joked around about that a million times in this podcast, that one day in the future, there's gonna come a time where you can read each other's minds. And you'll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a non-verbal, non-physical way, where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth. Well, yeah, exactly. And make noises, and make noises. Exactly, so when you... Like, what happens when you... Let's say you've got some complex idea that you're trying to convey to somebody else. And how do you do that? Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words, and there's a lot of loss, information loss, that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words. And when you say those words, those words are then interpreted, then they're decompressed by the person who is listening, and they will at best get a very incomplete understanding of what you're trying to convey. It's very difficult to convey complex concept with precision. Because you've got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly. And so communication is difficult. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Yes, and there's a great movie. There's an interpretation factor too, like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in different ways. And they're dependent upon tone, dependent upon social cues, even facial expressions, sarcasm. There's a lot of variables. Yeah, sarcasm is difficult. Yes. And so one of the things that I've said is that there could be potentially a universal language that's created through computers that particularly young kids would pick up very quickly. Like my kids do TikTok and all this jazz, and I don't know what they're doing. They just know how to do it. And they know how to do it really quickly. Like they learn really quickly, and they show me how to edit things. And it's if you taught a child from first grade on how to use some new universal language, I mean, essentially like a Rosetta Stone and something that's done with that interprets your thoughts, and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation with clear, very clear, where you know what a person's saying, and you can tell them what you're saying. And there's no need for noises, no need for mouth noises, no need for these sort of accepted ways that we've sort of evolved to make sounds that we all agree through our cultural dictionary, and we agree or certain we could bypass all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can still do it for fundamental reasons. Right. Like campfires. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. I don't need campfires. I don't need to roast marshmallows, which is kind of fun. So yeah, I think you would in principle, you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas. And language would not show what would happen to language. But you could probably, within a situation like this, that you would be able to just feel kind of like the matrix, you want to speak a different language. Right. That's why it was downloaded the program. Right. Right. So at least for the first iterations, first few iterations, we'll just be able to use like, I know that Google has their, some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time. Sure. Yeah, you can hear it. And they'll it'll play things back to you and whatever language you choose. So to be something along those lines for the first few iterations. Yeah. Well, the first few iterations are, I mean, what I'm talking about is like in the limit over time, you know, with a lot of development, the first few iterations, really in the first few versions, all we're going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries. Um, so it's like, don't, don't, don't worry that there's not going to sneak up on you. Um, does this, this will take a while. How many years before you don't have to talk? If the, if, if the development continues to accelerate, then maybe like five years, five to 10 years. That's quick. That's really quick. That's the best case scenario. No talking anymore in five. Best case scenario. Best case scenario. But tens, tens more like it. I've always speculated that aliens could potentially be us in the future, because if you look at like the size of their heads and the fact that they have very little muscle and they're, they're, they don't use their their mouth anymore. They was tiny little, I mean, the archetypal alien that you see in like closing counters of the third kind, they're like, if you went from, like, Australia Pythagus, or ancient hominid to us, what's the difference less hair, less muscle, bigger head, and then just keep going 1000 million, whatever your or five years, whatever, whatever happens when neural link goes on online, and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don't use our muscles anymore. We have this gigantic head, we can talk without words where you could also save state and save state, save state, like, save your brain state, like, like a saved game in a video game and save state. Whoa. Like, like if you want to swap from Windows 95. Well, like, well, a little better than that. But yeah, I think we are Windows 95 right now. My future, my future perspective, probably. But yeah, I mean, you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you if you wanted to in the future, in principle, it's like nothing like from a physics standpoint that prevents us that you'd be a little different, but then you're also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday, and you're a little different. In fact, if you say like, you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference. Yeah. So you'd be substantially you I mean, you'd be you'd certainly think you're you but the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state, like you can hang out with 30 year old you and the possibilities are endless. I mean, these things think like how your phone can you can record videos on your phone. Like there's no way you could remember a video right as accurately as your phone or a camera, you know, could. So if you've got like, you know, some some, you know, version 10, your link, whatever, and far in the future, you could, you could remember, you could recall everything, but just like it's a movie, including all the entire sensory experience, emotions, everything, everything, everything, and play it back. And edit it like this. Yeah. You could change what you think was your past. Yeah. Well, so if you had like, this whole thing right now Could be a replay memory. Well, so if you had like this whole thing right now, it could be Yeah, it maybe what's the odds of this being a replay memory, if you had a guess. It's more than 50%. Yeah, there's no way to assign a probability with accuracy here. Right, but roughly, if you just had a just gut instinct. Well, I don't have a neural link in my brain, so I'd say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a neural link, then it rises above 0%. The idea that we're experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is, even though it's still the same, it's not comforting, right? For some reason, when people talk about simulation theory, they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation. Even though your life might be wonderful, you might be in love, you might love your career, you might have great friends, but it's not comforting to know that this experience somehow or another doesn't exist in a material form that you can knock on. Feels real, doesn't it? Feels real! Feels real! But the The idea that it's not is, for some strange reason, disconcerting. Well, yeah, I'm sure it should be disconcerting. Because then if this is not real, what is? Right. But there's that old sort of thought experiment of, how do you know you're not a brain in a vat? I mean, here's the thing. You are a brain in a vat. Then that vat is your skull. Yes. And everything you see, feel, hear, everything. All your senses are electrical signals. Everything, everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vat where the vat is your skull. And all your hormones, all your neurotransmitters, all these things are drugs. Adrenaline is a drug. Dopa means a drug. You're a drug factory. You're constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and beauty. Changes your state. Great music changes your state. Absolutely, sure. And yet, here's another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say, where did consciousness arise? Well, assuming you believe in physics, which appears to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, like basically elements of periodic table, but mostly hydrogen, basically. And then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later, that hydrogen became sentient. Where along the way did consciousness, what's the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here? When do we call it? When do we call it consciousness? I was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey, riding a motorcycle down the street, jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby. Yeah, I saw that one, it worked out well. Is that monkey conscious? It seems like it is. It seems like it had a plan. It was riding a fucking motorcycle and the jumped off the motorcycle to try to steal a baby. Yeah, I saw that one. It worked out well. Yeah, seems pretty. The one that just dragged baby down the street pretty far. Yeah. Yeah. It seems pretty confident. Yeah, it seems pretty conscious, right? There's definitely some degree of consciousness there. Yeah, it's not like it's not a worm. It seems to be on another level Yeah, and it's gonna keep going and That that's the real concern When when people think about the potential future versions of human beings, especially when you consider Symbiotic relationship to artificial intelligence that will be unrecognizable That one day will be so far removed from what this is We'll look back on this the way we look back now on you know Simple simple organisms that we evolved from it seems to be and that it won't be that far in the future That we do have this this view back well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more more sophisticated and complex and and that it understands the Questions to ask about the universe. Do you think that's the case? As a human being as yourself, you're clearly Really? Trying to make conscious decisions to be a better version of you, right? This is the idea of like getting rid of your possessions and realizing that you're trying to like I don't like this I will try to improve this I will try to do a better version of the way I interface with reality That this is always the way things are if you're if you're moving in a some sort of a direction where you're trying to improve things you're always gonna move into this new place where you look back on the old place and go ah, I was doing it wrong back then, so this is an accelerated version of that. A super accelerated version of that. Yes, I mean, you don't always improve, but you can aspire to improve. Ah, you can aspire to be less wrong. Yeah. This is like, I think a good, the tools of physics are very powerful, like, just assume you're wrong and you're asking your goal to be less wrong. I don't think you're going to, if you succeed everyday and being less wrong, but if you're gonna succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you're doing great. Yeah, that's a great way of putting an aspire to be less wrong. But then when people look back on nostalgia about simpler times, there's that too. It's very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires. But you can still have a campfire. Yes, yes. But will you appreciate it when you're a super nerd, when you're connected to the grid, and you have some skull cap in place of the top of your head, and it's interfacing with the international language, that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people? Yeah, sure, I think so. Yeah, I like campfires. I'm just worried. I mean, everyone's always scared of change, but I'm scared of this monumental change where we won't talk anymore. I mean, that thing- We'll communicate. Yes, but that's- We'll communicate. There's something about the beauty of the crudeness of language, where when it's done eloquently, it's satisfying, and it hits us in some sort of a visceral way. Like, ah, that person nailed it. I love that they nailed it. Like, that it's so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way, in an articulate way, that makes someone- Like, you read a quote, a great quote by a wise person, it makes you excited that their mind figured something out, put the words together in a right way that makes your brain pop. Like, oh yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Clever compression of a concept. Yeah. And a feeling. Yeah. And a feeling. But the fact that a human did it, too. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Do you think that it'll be electronic music? Like, people won't appreciate it, like they appreciate a slide guitar? I like electronic music. I do, too. Yeah. While you make it. I know you like it. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, and I hope the future is more fun and interesting and I appreciate you trying to make it that way. I hope it's more fun and interesting, too. Yeah. I just, you know, I just hope you don't lose anything along the way. Yeah, at least a little. But hopefully we'll gain. But hopefully we gain more than we lose. Yeah, that's the thing, right, gaining more than we lose. Something that makes us interesting is that we're so flawed. It's not for sure. It's not for sure. I mean, I look at civilizations through the ages, Most of them, you know, they rose and fell. Yeah. And I do think like the globalization that we have at the sort of like the meme sphere is, there's not enough isolation between countries or regions. It's like if you get up, if there's a mind virus, that mind virus can infect too much of the world. You know, like I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people because it's like, man, we don't ever want to, everywhere it will be the same for sure. And then we need some kind of like mind viral immunity. So that's what's concerning. Mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like neural link gets established, the real concern is something that, I mean, you said it's Bluetooth, right? Or some future version of that. That the idea is that something could possibly get into it and fuck it up, or some future version of that. No, I'm talking about like somebody, there's some kind of concept that happens right now. Why not this viruses and embedded chips, right? Like people have embedded chips and then acquired viruses. They've embedded. Well, what I'm talking about a mind virus, I'm talking about a concept that infects people's minds. Oh, okay, okay. Like cult thinking or some sort of fundamentalism. Okay, some sort of fundamentalism. Yeah, just some wrong-handed idea that just goes viral in an idea sense. Yeah, mm. Well, that is a problem too, right? If someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational. Yeah, yeah. Would that be an issue too with, this is a very have versus have not issue, right? Once this thing, if this really does, I mean, initially it's going to help people with injuries but you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change. Yes. But the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don't have it yet. Yes, well, I mean, it's the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don't know, dramatically maybe by a factor of 10 with it. So you could definitely just, you know, I don't know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Yeah. Should be super smart. Yeah. Should be super smart. Well, in a capitalist society, you know, it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well, he'd be so far ahead they could never catch you. Is that a concern? Well, I think the, I'm just not a super huge concern. I mean, there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. Yeah. I mean, you can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that's far smarter than an individual. Like I couldn't personally build like a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That's impossible. But, you know, we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and like, you know, piecing it out to different people and using like, you know, computers and machines and stuff, we can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station, that kind of thing, you know. So that already exists where there's, you know, where there's a, corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. Yeah. But the, like we should be, I think, less concerned about like relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly, you know, beyond us and decoupled from human will, you know. Decoupled from human, so this is the, if you can't beat them, join them. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean. So you feel, so you feel like it's inevitable, like AI, it's essentially an AI. It's essentially inevitable. Super sentient AI, yeah. Like beyond a level that's difficult to understand. Impossible to understand, probably. And somehow or another, us, so it's almost like, it's a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with AI. It's not a requirement, it's just if you wanna be along for the ride, then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you've got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of, for argument's sake, it's like the limbic system, basically. And you've got the cortex. Now the brain purists will argue with this definition, but essentially you've got the primitive brain and you've got the sort of smart brain, or the brain that's capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can't understand. Now the, your cortex is much, much smarter than your limbic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven't met anyone who wants to delete the limbic system or the cortex. That people are quite happy having both. So you can think of the, this as being, like the computer of the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that is, like that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It would be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers. And you actually have that right now. Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. You know, storing your terabytes of information perfectly. Doing incredible calculations that, you know, we couldn't even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It's just like I said, the data rate is slow. The connection is weak. Why is it so disconcerting? Or why does it not give me comfort to think about, like when I think about a symbiotic connection to AI, I always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. Is that a bad way to look at it? I don't think that's not quite, that's not how it would be. Like I said, you already are symbiotic with AI or computers. Yeah, phones, computers, laptops. Yeah, yeah. And there's quite a bit of AI going on. You know, so artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming, more and more. So you are connected. You know, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it's using a neural net to decode your speech and try to understand what you're saying. You know, if you're trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of your photograph, it's using the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it's just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow. When do you think you're gonna do it? How long will you wait? Like once it starts becoming available? Once it starts becoming available? Yeah, if it works, I'll do it, sure. Right away. I mean, let's make sure it works. How do we make sure it works? We try it on prisoners? Like what do you do? No, no. Take rapists? No. Cut holes in their head? No, like I said, if somebody's got a serious brain injury. Right. And then, you know, people have very severe brain injuries. And then you can fix those brain injuries. And then you prove out that it works and you have envelope expand and make more and more brain injuries. It's sold more and more. And then at a certain age, we all are gonna get Alzheimer's. We're all gonna get senile. And then, you know, moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing. And so, you know, it's like you said, okay, well, you know, this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you're able to function much later in life. So I think that, so essentially, almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use a neural link. And then it's like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer. Right. Do you ever sit down and extrapolate? Do you ever sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to? Yeah, I mean, I think that's, sure, think about it a lot. There's, yeah, I mean, I think that's, like I said, there's not something that's gonna sneak up on you. You know, there's like getting FDA approval for this stuff is not like overnight, you know. And, you know, there's, I mean, we probably, we have to be on like version 10 or something before, you know, it would realistically be, you know, a human AI, somebody, a situation. So you'll see it coming, you know. You see it coming, but what do you think it's gonna be? Like when you sit, when you're alone, if you have free time, I don't know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next, onward, keep going, and you drag it out with improvements along the way, and leaps and bounds, and technological innovations, and where do you see it? What are we gonna be? Like when? 20, 25 years from now, what are we gonna be? Well, seeming civilization is still around. It's looking fragile right now. I think we could have a, in 25 years, probably something, I would think there could be a whole brain interface. A whole brain interface. Something pretty close to that, yeah. How does, how do you define, what do you mean by whole brain interface? Like almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself, if you want. AI extension of yourself. What does that mean to you, like when you say AI extension of yourself. Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself in your phone, you know, and computers and stuff so, and online, it's like somebody dies, there's like an online ghost that their online stuff is still alive in your phones. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone's tweets after they're dead. Yeah. Yeah, Instagram and their stories and stuff. Yeah. Whatever, Facebook and stuff. That's a great way to put it, yeah. That's a great way to put it. It's like an online ghost. That's very accurate. Yeah, so it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body. More of you. Now, when you say civilization is fragile, do you mean because of this COVID-19 shit that's going on right now? What's that? I've never heard of it. It's this thing. Yeah, I know. It's like some people just get a cough. My idea, what are you talking about? Other people, it gets much worse. Sure. It's this thing. Yeah, I know. We'll just get a cough. My idea, what are you talking about? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking. Yeah. Well, out of nowhere, that's what's crazy. It's like you go back to November, nothing. Now, here we are, December, January, February, March, April, May, six months. Totally different world. So from nothing to everything's locked down. There's so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed, what has happened. You find things where there was a meat packing plant, I believe in Missouri, where 300 plus people were asymptomatic, tested positive, were asymptomatic. And then in other places, it just ravages entire communities and kills people. And it's so weird. It almost appears on the, like if you didn't know any better, you'd be like, what? It seems like there's a bunch of different viruses. It doesn't seem like it's the same thing. Or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of people. Yeah. I mean, I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it's kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. So yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It's much, much less. It's like probably at least a order of magnitude less. Well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems. Yeah, I mean, if you're, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have like basically existing conditions and by age and if you're below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It's not zero, but it's extremely low. They didn't think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it's a situation where once they've proceeded in a certain way, it's very difficult to correct course? It's almost like people really wanted a panic. It's quite crazy. But in some places, a panic is deserved, right? Like if you're in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone's on intubators and it seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick, in some places that fear is justified. But then in other places, you're reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They're having to furlough doctors and nurses because there's no work for them. Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases, they're at 30% capacity. And is this because they've decided to forego elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for? Yes, I mean, and we're not talking about just, some of these elective procedures are quite important. It's like you have a bad heart. And you need a triple bypass. It's like sort of elective, but if you don't get it done in time, you're gonna die. It's bad heart. And you need a triple bypass. Elective is a weird word. Elective is a weird word. It's not like plastic surgery. It's like, it's more like my hip is, I'm in extreme pain because my hip's blown out, or my knee, and I don't wanna go to the hospital, I can't go to the hospital to, you know, people in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, you know, like people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it's a problem. It's not good, it's not good. It seems like the state of public perception is shifting. It is. Like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing, and because of the statistics of, I mean, and essentially across the board, it's being recognized that it's not as fatal as we thought it was. Still dangerous, still worse than the flu, but not as bad as we thought, or we feared it could be. It is. Objectively, the mortality is much lower, like at least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought. Do you think that the current way we're handling this, the social distancing, the masks, the locking down, does this make sense? Is it adequate, or do you think that we should move back to, at least closer to where we used to be? Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing, no matter what. You know, wash your hands and, you know, and if you're coughing, stay home or wear a mask. This is not good, you know. If I could do that in Japan, that's like normal. If you're ill, you wear a face mask and you don't cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands, it's also good. Well, that's the speculation Yeah, it's worse. Well, that's the speculation why men get it more than women, because men are disgusting, we don't wash our hands as much. Men are disgusting, it's true. It's true, I admit. All men in this room, we're all gross, we watch our hands as much. Men are disgusting, it's true. I admit it, bro, I'm all men and women. Yes, go to the restroom, you can see us. Yes, we're gross, my daughter, yes, we're gross. My daughter, my nine-year-old daughter yells at me. She goes, did you wash your hands? She makes me go back and wash my hands. She's right. Nine years old, if I had a nine-year-old boy, you think you would care? You wouldn't give a fuck if I washed my hands. True. So, yeah, I think there's definitely some civil endings here, and improved hygiene, and- Yes, and awareness of potential. Yes, and I think this has shaken up the system. The system is somewhat maravund, with a lot of layers of bureaucracy, and I think that we've cut through some of that bureaucracy. And if we, at some point, there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate, debate about what's high, but I mean, someone that's killing a lot of 20-year-olds, let's say, like if you had Ebola type of mortality. Spanish flu, something, taxing the existence of healthy people, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Taxing the existence of healthy people, yeah. Yeah, but it's, yeah, killing large numbers of young, healthy people, that's, you know, to find that as high mortality, then that, this is at least practice for something like that. And I think there's, given it's a matter of time, that there will be eventually some such pandemic. Do you think that, in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality, that we got lucky in the sense, I mean, people that didn't get lucky and died, of course, I'm not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I'm saying overall, as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures. Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's a good chance, it's highly likely, I think, coming out of this, that we will develop vaccines that we didn't have before for coronaviruses and other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it's received. So there's definitely a lot of silver linings here. And- Potentially, potentially, if we act correctly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's, I think there will be some amount of silver lining here no matter what. Hopefully it could be more of a silver lining than less. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, this is kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate. And we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young, healthy people. Yeah. When you made a series of tweets recently, I don't remember the exact wording, but essentially you were saying free America now, like let's open it back. That is the exact wording. That is it, thank you. But how much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff, and what was the response? Did anybody go, hey, Elon, what the fuck you doing? Did anybody pull you aside? Yeah, of course. I just think it's like quitting. That is it, thank you. Pull you aside? Of course. Who does that? Who gets to do that to you? Well, I mean, I certainly get that. There's no shortage, and I got feedback on Twitter. Oh yeah, Twitter. But I don't read that. Do you read it? Warzone. You do sometimes though, right? You do read it. Do you read it? Warzone. Yeah, I mean, I scroll through the comments. Like I said, it has a meme warzone. Yeah. Like people knife you good in Twitter. It's something I enjoy about that just the, there's something about the freedom of expression that comes from all these people that do attack you. It's like, well, if there was no vulnerability whatsoever, they wouldn't attack you. And it's like there's something about these millions and millions of perspectives that you have to appreciate. Even if it comes your way, even if the shit storm hits you in the face, you got to appreciate, wow, how amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves? I mean, you don't necessarily want to be there when the shit hits you. You might want to get out of the way in anticipation of the shit storm, but the fact that so many people have the ability to reach out. And I think it's in a lot of ways, it's, I don't want to say a misused resource, but it's like giving monkeys guns. They just start gunning down things that are in front of them without any realization of what they're doing. They have a rock, they see a window, they throw it. Whoa, look at that, I got Elon mad. Look at that, this guy got mad at me. This, I fucking took this person down on Twitter. I got this lady fired. Oh, the fucking business is going under because of Twitter Wars. It seems like there's something about it that's this new found thing that, I don't want to say abuse, but just I want to say that it's almost like, you hit the button and things blow up, you're like, wow. What else can we blow up? Sure, I mean, I've been in the Twitter war zone for a while here, so it takes a lot to phase me at this point. Yeah, that's good too, right? Like you develop a thick skin. Yeah, you can take it personally. A lot of these people don't actually know you. It's like if you're fighting a war and there's some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it's not like they hate you, they don't even know you. Right, yeah. So just think of it like that, they have fire and bullets or whatever, but they don't know you, so don't take it personally. There's something interesting about it too. It's like when you write something in 280 characters and they write something into it, it's such a crude way. It's like someone's sending opposing smoke signals that refute your smoke signals. It's so crude, especially when you're talking about something like Neuralink. You're talking about some future potential where you're gonna be able to express pure thoughts that get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus tweets. Well, there'll always be some ambiguity, but tweets are, it's hard. Maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something. Right, right. Or I'm not just kidding or whatever, you know. It seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it's sarcasm. If everybody knew that the onion wasn't real, if you sent people articles, it is something about someone getting angry at an onion article. Wow, that's amazing. You know what I mean, where they don't realize what it is, there's something fun about that for everybody else. Yeah, onion's pretty great, might be the best news source. Do you know who Titania McGrath is? Hilarious, it's Andrew Boyle. He's a British fellow, brilliant guy, who's been on the podcast before and he has this fictional character, this pseudonym, Titania McGrath, who's like the ultimate social justice warrior. Does this have a female avatar or something? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. A female avatar, that's actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces. It's not really one person, so one person can't be a victim and be angry. He's sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice warrior. But I recognized it early on before I met him that this was parody, this was just fun. And then I love reading the people that don't recognize that. They get angry. And there's a lot of people that just get really furious about some fun to that. There's some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the signal. It's not one person making this one. I find Twitter quite engaging. How do you have the time? Why, I mean, it's like five minutes every couple hours type of thing. It's not like I'm sitting on an all day. But even five minutes every couple hours, if those are bad five minutes, they might be bouncing around in your head for the next 30. Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from. You read this and you're like, okay, it's bullets being fired by an opposing army. Don't like, it's not like they know you. It's like, don't take it personally. Did you feel the same way when CNN had that stupid shit about ventilators with you? I found that both confusing and the... Yeah, that was annoying. It was annoying, but it was also annoying as a person who reads CNN and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. I would like to think that. I would like to think that. Yeah, I don't think CNN is that. I think it used to be. It used to be, yeah. What do you think's the best source of just like information out there? That's a good question. Like, let's say you're just like average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what's going on, like how to live your life and just looking for what's going on in the world. It's hard to find something that isn't. That's a good question. That's good. Yeah. Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to make sloppy reporting and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. Yeah. You're just trying to figure out what's going on. It's like, I'm hard pressed to, where do you go? Yeah. I don't know. I don't think there's any pure form. My favorite places are the New York Times and the LA Times. And I don't trust them 100%. Because also, there's individuals that are writing these stories. And that seems to be the problems, these individual biases and these individual, there's purposely distorted perceptions. And then there's ignorantly reported facts. And there's so many variables. And you've got to put everything through this filter of where's this person coming from. Do they have political biases? Do they have social biases? Are they upset because of their own shortcomings? And are they projecting this into the story? It's so hard, stories. Exactly. I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to the publication. I go with whatever Matt Taibbi says. Okay. I trust him more than anybody. All right. Matt Taibbi's onto something. I just, as far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything, I just listen to him above most, above most, he's my go-to guy. All right, I'll check it out. Oh, it's Rolling Stone's articles. His stuff on the savings and loan crisis, he's just like, what in the fuck? Sure. And he wasn't an economist by any stretch of the imagination. So he had to really sort of deeply embed himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it. Yep. And with also with the humorous flair. No, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. But it's not that many of them. It's hard and not a location where we are no bullshit. We are no bullshit.com. The one place where you can say, this is what we know, this is what we don't know, this is what we think, not this person's wrong and here's why. Like, oh, God damn it. You know, I can't. You don't know. There's a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation. Yeah. This particular coronavirus issue that we're dealing with right now seems to be a great illuminator of that very fact is that there's so much data and there's so much that's open to interpret. There's so many things, because it's all happening in real time, right? And like particularly right now in California, we're in stage two tomorrow or Friday, two days from now. Stage two, retail stores opening up. Things are changing. Like, no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives, but yet ensure that our culture and that our economy survives. It's a lot of speculation and guessing, but if you go to certain places, they'll tell you, we know why and we know this and we know, oh, it's hard. It's hard to know. Yeah, I mean, in general, I think that's like, we should be concerned about anything that's a massive infringement on our civil liberties. Yes. So it's like, you gotta put a lot of weight on that. A lot of people die to win independence with the country and fight for the democracy that we have. And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. I think we probably did that, actually. Yes. Well, I like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home, require people to not go to work, and to arrest people for trying to make a living, this all seems wrong. And I think it's a wrong approach. It's an infantilization of the society. That dad is gonna tell you what to do. Fundamentally, a violation of the Constitution, freedom of assembly and it's just, I mean, I don't think these things stand up in court, really. Yeah, they're arresting people for protesting because they're protesting and violating social distancing and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home. Yeah, these would definitely not stand up if the Supreme Court here, I mean, it's obviously complete violation, right? Yeah, yeah. And again, this is not in any way disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. It's certainly a real thing to think of. Yeah, I mean, it just should be, if you're at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but you should also not be, if you're not at risk or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life you should have the right to do that. Right, and it seems like at this point in time, particularly, our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life how they did, particularly having a career and making a living and feeding your family. Paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open, paying your bills. Yes, I mean, there's a strong downside to this. Yeah. So, yeah, I just believe if this is a free country, you should be allowed to do what you want, as long as it does not endanger others. But that's the thing, right? This is the argument they will bring up. You are endangering others. You should stay home for the people that, even if you're fine, even if you know you're going to be OK, there's certain people that will not be OK, because of your actions. They might get exposed to this thing that we don't have a vaccine for. We don't have universally accepted treatment for. And then we need to, there's two arguments, right? One argument is we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let's open up the economy. The other argument is stop placing money over human lives. And let's shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision. And let's figure out some way to develop some sort of universal basic income plan or something like that to feed people during this time where we make this transition. I think there's a nuance. Yeah, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants to stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn't want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That's my opinion. And if somebody doesn't like that, well, that's my opinion. So now, yeah, this notion, though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true, obviously. Some people have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of planty. Do you think that- Like, it just makes stuff. Stuff, you know, there's a magic horn of planty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of planty and then if, like, if somebody has more stuff than somebody else's, it's because they took more from this magic horn of planty. Now, let me just break it to the fools out there. If you don't make stuff, there's no stuff. Yeah, so if you don't make the food, if you don't process the food, you know, transport the food and the, you know, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there's no stuff. I would become detached from reality. You can't just legislate money and solve these things. If you don't make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously. We'll run out of the stores, run out of the, you know, the machine just grinds to a halt. But the initial thought on this virus, the real fear was that this was gonna kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people instantaneously in this country. It was gonna do it very quickly. If we didn't hunker down, if we didn't shelter in place, if we didn't quarantine ourselves or lock down, do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be? Maybe, I think, briefly. Briefly. Briefly, but I think if, you know, any kind of, like, sensible examination of what happened in China would lead to the conclusion that that is obviously not gonna occur. This virus originated in Wuhan. There was like, I don't know, 100,000 people a day leaving Wuhan. So it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world. And the fatality rate was low. Don't you think, though, it's difficult to appreciate? It's difficult to filter the information that's coming out of China, to accurately really get a real true representation of what happened. The propaganda machine is very strong. Sure. What the World Health Organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda. Sure. Well, the thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China, like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers, like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they have issues or not. Then China is back at full steam. And many, pretty much every US company has some significant numbers of supplies in China. So you know if they're able to provide things or not, or if there's high mortality rate. Tesla has like welds 10,000 people in China. So zero people died. Mmmm. That's a real statistic. That's coming from, yeah. Yeah, you know those people. Yeah, you know those people. We literally were in peril. Do you think there's a danger of this? Do you think there's a danger of this? Same folks are there? Yeah, still there. Do you think there's a danger of politicizing. becomes like opening up the country is Donald Trump's it's his goal it's his and then anything he does is sort of there's there's people that are gonna oppose it and come up with some reasons why he's wrong particularly in this climate whereas as we're leading up to November and you know the 2020 elections do you think that this is a real danger in terms of public's perception that Trump wants to open it up so they need jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump there yeah I think there has been some well doesn't this has been politicized you know both directions really so it's which of which is not great yeah but like said separate apart from that I think there's the question of like you know where does civil liberties fit in this picture you know yeah and what what can the government make you do what can they make you not do and what you know what's okay. Right. Yeah, right. Yeah, I think we went too far. Do you think it's one of those things where once we've gone in a certain direction, it's very difficult to make a correction, make an adjustment to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing. It's not good, but it's not what we feared. So let's back up and reconsider, and let's do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially, that information appears to be faulty. And here's how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country was founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom that we respect and appreciate. Absolutely. Well, I think we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country. It's gonna happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. So yeah, something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting sort of COVID cases to separate out diagnosed with COVID versus had COVID like symptoms. Yes. Because the list of symptoms that could be COVID at this point is like a mile long. So it's like hard to, if you're ill at all, it's like it could be COVID. So just to give you better information, definitely diagnosed with COVID or had COVID like symptoms. We're conflating those two. Yes. So it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was COVID a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has COVID, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has COVID, it's gonna get recorded as a COVID death. Is that real? I mean, basically. Not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes. Get hit by a bus. Cancer. I mean, basically. Not cancer. If you get hit by a bus, go to the hospital and die. And then find that you have COVID, you will be recorded as a COVID death. Why would they do that though? Well, right now, so the road to hell is paid with good intentions. I mean, it's mostly paid with bad intentions, but there is some good intentions paving zones in there too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overrun with COVID patients created an incentive to record something as COVID that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital is going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So the hospitals are in a bind right now. There's a bunch of hospitals, they're following doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital is half full, you're, it's hard to make ends meet. So now you've got like, you know, I just checked this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back, or I got to fire some doctors. So this is a tough moral quandary. It's like, what are you gonna do? That's the situation we have. What's the way out of this? What do you think is like, if you had the president's ear or if people wanted to just listen to you openly, what do you think is the way out of this? Let's clear up the data, clear up the data. So, like I said, something should be recorded as COVID, only if it is somebody that's been tested, has received a positive COVID test, not if they simply have symptoms, one of like 100 symptoms. And then if it is a COVID death, it must be separated. Or was this, was COVID a primary reason for death? Or did they also have stage three cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by a bus? And had COVID. I've read all this stuff about that, about them diagnosing people as a COVID death, despite other variables. This is not a question. This is what is occurring. And where are you reading this from? Where are you getting this from? The public health officials have literally said this. This is not a question mark. Right. But this is unprecedented, right? Like if someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack. Yes. Yeah, so this is unprecedented. Is this because this is such a popular, I don't want to use that word the wrong way, but that's what I mean, a popular subject and financial incentives. Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of moral indictment of sort of hospital administrators. It's just, they're in a tough spot here. They actually don't have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff and potentially going bankrupt. So then they're like, okay, well, the stimulus bill says if we get all this money, if we say, if it's a COVID death, I'm like, okay. They coughed before they died. Yeah. In fact, they're not even diagnosed as COVID. They simply, if you had weakness, a cough, a shortness of breath. Frankly, I'm not sure how you die without those things. Yeah. Right, there's so many different things that you could attribute to COVID too. There's so many symptoms. There's diarrhea, headaches, dehydration, cough. Yes, but to be clear, you don't even need to have gotten a COVID diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it's COVID. So then it makes the death count look very high and then we're then stuck in a vine because it looks like the death count's super high and not going down like it should be. And now, so then we should keep whatever, the shelter in place stuff there and keep people in their home, confine people to homes. So we need to get break out of this. We're stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information. Clarity of information will certainly help, but altering perceptions, public perception from people that are basically in a panic. There's a lot of, essentially, well, at least a month ago, we're clearly in a panic. I mean, right where, when you look around April 5th, April 6th, people were really freaking out. But here we are, May and May, people are relaxing a little bit. They're realizing like, hey, I actually know a couple of people that got it. It was just a cough and I know some people that got it where nothing happened. Yes, I know a lot of people who got it. I know zero people who died. I mean, I know a lot of people who got it. Yeah, it's not what we feared. We feared something much worse. That's correct. So the adjustment is difficult to make. So you said, first of all, we need real data. Just parse out the data. Don't lump it all together. And if you give people, just parse out the data better, clear information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis? Or was it a, did they get the test? And the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out. And then parse out just, if somebody died, did they die? Did they even have a COVID test? Or did they just have one of many symptoms? Like, how do you die without weakness? I don't know. Right, of course. Basically, if you're gonna die, you're gonna have shortness of breath, weakness, and you might cough a little. So was it quantified? Yeah, that person, did they actually have a COVID test? And the tests come back positive. And then if they died, did they die where COVID was? It doesn't have to be the main course, but it was a significant contributor to their death. Or was it not a significant contributor to their death? No, I don't know. Right, of course. It's impossible. It's as simple as just because you had COVID, COVID killed you. Is it definitely not? Right. Yeah. I mean, people die all the time, and they have flu and other colds, and we don't say that they died of those flu and other colds. Yes. Well, that's what's so weird about this. It's so popular, and I use that word in a weird way, but it's so popular that we've kind of forgotten. People die pneumonia every day. People die of, the flu didn't take a break. Oh, COVID's got this. I'm going to sit this one out. I'm going to be on the bench. I'm going to wait until COVID's done before I jump back into the game of killing people. No, the flu's still here killing people. It's absurd. Yeah. Every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu. Yeah. Not tangentially. Right. Not every... Yeah, 61,000 in this country last year. Yeah, and we're only 5% of the world. And then there's cigarettes. So, oh man, cigarettes, not cigarettes will really kill you. That's a weird one, right? We're terrified of this disease that were projected could potentially kill 100, if not 200,000 Americans this year with cigarettes killed 500,000. And you don't hear a peep out of any politician. There's no one running for Congress that's trying to ban cigarettes. There's no one running for Senate that wants to put some education plan in place that's going to stop cigarettes in their tracks. Yeah. I mean, a long time, like several years ago, or maybe a long time, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You For Smoking. Oh, I saw that. I saw that. Yeah. It... Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. Barbecuing your lungs is just bad news. It's not good, you know. You're turning your lungs into smoked beef, not great. So, yeah. Thailand all of a sudden, by the way, it also kills a lot of people. What is the number for Tylenol over here? I'm not sure the exact number, but I believe until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs. Because... Wow. Basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially, it causes liver failure. Oh. So people would get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a tonic down on all its curtains. Whoa. Curtains is a funny word. Yeah. But nobody's raging against Tylenol. Whoa. Yeah. Curtains is a funny word. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird, acceptable deaths are weird. And that's the real slippery slope about this people shaming people for wanting to go back to work. Other people are gonna die. Well, if you drive, do you drive? Well, you should stop driving because people die from driving. So you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools, cause like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming. So let's not swim anymore, so let's not swim anymore. What is the really danger? We need to chop down all the coconut trees. It's dumb water. Coconuts kill 150 people every year. Yes. Cut down all the coconut trees, we need those people. Yes. It's at a certain point in time, it's like... Yeah, we're vulnerable. And we also have a finite existence, no matter what. Coconut trees. I mean, I think you want to look at, say, death as like the, but for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years. So if somebody dies when they're 20 and could have lived till 80, they last 60 years. But if somebody dies when they're 80 and they might have lived till 81, they last one year. So it's like how many life years were lost is probably the right metric to use. Yeah. Yeah. I don't read my own comments, but I do read other people's comments and I was reading this one little Twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that COVID takes an average of 10 years off people's lives and we should appreciate those 10 years. And then someone else said, I'm sure it's not true. It's the Twitter. Oh my God, but someone else said the average age of people who die from COVID is older than the average age. People die. Yeah, definitely. It's the Twitter. It's very, let's say just say it's like, it's, it's about the same. That's a beautiful way of looking at it. I mean, it's, it's unfortunate. It sucks, but it sucks if grandpa dies of Alzheimer's or emphysema or leukemia. It sucks. Sure. It sucks when someone you love dies. Yes. I mean, actually if, if this, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that if, if you have, you know, grandparents and their age of grandparents, really be careful with, with, with, you know, any kind of flu or cold or something that, that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to, to the elderly is it basically, if you're kids got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents no matter what it is. It's, it's the things that are, where a young immune system is, has no problem and older one has, has a problem. And in fact, a lot of the, a lot of the deaths are just are literally, it's tragic, but they're, they're intra-family and it's the, you know, the little, little kid had a, had a, you know, cold or flu. Give it to grandpa. Yeah. It's a family gathering and they don't know that this is a big deal, but it's, it's just important to remember when you get old, your, your immune system is just not that strong. And so just be, be careful with your, with your, you know, loved ones or elderly. Give it to grandpa. Yeah. Yeah. And I think there is some true objective understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system, and I really think that that, that information should be, that should be distributed in a way, a non-judgmental way. But like, look, this is, this is a way that we can all, like this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones. And maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and, and people that are vulnerable, you know, vitamin C, heat shock proteins, all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system. Yeah, actually just, a thing that is tough, like when you, as you get older, it's hard to be, you tend to put on weight. You know, I certainly, that's happening with me. You know, like as an older I get, I'm like damn, it's harder to stay lean, that's for sure. And so actually being overweight is a big deal. Yeah. It's just a fact, well, yeah. The New York hospital said it was the number one factor for severe COVID symptoms was obesity. That's correct. That was the number one factor. That's correct. It is, that's, yes, exactly. But it's also, we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people's feelings. Yeah, absolutely. We don't wanna bring up the fact that being fat's bad for you. It's a judgment on your. The food's great. Yeah, I do love food. Yeah, absolutely. We don't want, yeah. Yeah, and I mean, to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I'd rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life. Yeah, those moments of enjoying a great meal. Yeah. And then even talking about it, they're valuable. They're worth something. Yeah, it's not, we don't wanna eat Soylent Green and live to be 160. No, I don't wanna eat, tasty food is great. It's one of the best things about life. It's one of the best things about life. It really is, yeah. It's an art form as well. It's like fine food. It's a delicious sand castle. It's temporary, it doesn't last very long, but there's something about it that's very pleasing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine food. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I don't know what advice to give. Like, maybe smaller, have tasty food with smaller amounts of it. Yes, yes, yeah. And I think regulated feeding window's really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach. Sure. When I started doing that, I found myself to be quite a bit healthier. When I've deviated from that, I've gained weight. I think, 16 hours, well, like 16 hours, yeah. So like at night or? Yeah, yeah, yeah, 16 hours. Well, like 16 hours, yeah. So like at night or? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I get to a certain point and then I count out, I usually hit the stopwatch on my phone and then I look at 15 hours in, I'm like, okay, got an hour before I can eat. And so anything in between that is just water or coffee. Actually, yeah, actually, you know, like this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. And it can actually cause a heartburn that you don't even know is happening. And that subtle heartburn affects your sleep because you're horizontal and your body's digesting. So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and, you know, be healthier, it's do not eat right before we go to sleep. It's like one of the worst things you could do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have some of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. I've done that particularly after comedy shows, starving, try to come home and I'll eat. And then I go to bed and I just feel like, shit, and I wake up in the middle of the night. It's gonna, it's gonna crush your sleep and it's gonna damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus and it's so, in fact, drinking and then going to sleep, is that's one of the worst things you could do. Yes, yeah. So just try to avoid drinking and eating. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, don't, you know, it's gonna. Yes, yeah, exactly, don't, small amounts of alcohol that evidence suggests it's not, it doesn't have a negative effect on it. I put in the same category as delicious food. It kind of makes things a little more fun. Yeah, yeah. I like it. Yeah, yeah. I like it. I mean, some of the people who've lived the longest, you know, there was a woman in France who I think maybe has the record or close to it and she had a glass of wine every day, every day, you know. Yeah. Small, small amounts is fine. Yeah. But yeah, this is like, I learned this quite late in life. It's like just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep and your quality of life, your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot. For sure, yeah. This is, it's a big deal and I think not widely known. For sure, yeah. Do you have time to exercise? A little bit. Do you have a trainer or anything? I do, although I haven't seen him for a while, but yeah, especially if I'm out like, you know, say working on a starship or something in South Texas and I'm just living in my, I've got a little house there in Boca Chica village. You know, I don't have much to do so. Or like I'm working and I'll just lift some weights or something, you know. Maybe, like I don't, some people love running. I don't love running. But if I- What do you like to do exercise wise? Um, to be totally frank, I wouldn't exercise at all if I could, but if I, I'd prefer not to exercise, but if I'm gonna exercise and lift some weights and then kind of run on the treadmill and maybe watch a show that, you know, if there's a compelling show that like pulls you in. Right, right, right, yeah. I know, no. That's a good thing to do, yeah. Right, right, right, yeah. That's a good thing to do. Watch a good movie or- Yeah, yeah. Episode of Black Mirror or something like that is great. Yeah, yeah. Episode of Black- Don't watch Black Mirror before we down a bed either. Well don't watch Black Mirror today. It's too fucking accurate. Yeah, exactly. It's like wait, this already happened in real life. Yeah, they're just too close. It's too close. Well, even didn't Jamie. Didn't you say that the the guy who makes black mirror? Yeah, he said he it's not a good time to start season six. Yeah. Yeah He wants to hold off because his reality nailed it is black mirror. Oh, it's like he's gonna have to like reassess And attack it from a different angle. Yeah, you should try something. That's fun to do That's not just like like learn a martial art or something like that. It's a reality Yeah, I did martial arts when I was a kid. Did you wish to? I Did Taekwondo I did karate kakushinkai. All right, cool and judo Did you wish to? Cool. I'll say you really branched out. Yeah. Yeah so And did Brazilian jujitsu briefly did you yeah where I'm in Palo Alto where really? Yeah, I don't know shit. I was gonna suggest that that's a great thing for people Like that's a thing about jujitsu if you look at it from the outside you think oh a bunch of meathead strangling each other But there's some of the smartest people I know or jujitsu fiends because they they get They first of all they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense Sure, but then they realize that it's essentially like a language with your body like you're having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language and It's really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are sure the the more you'll succeed In these ventures. That's really also an accurate analogy of what you just do is Yeah, I mean I kind of got I mean probably like a lot of people For the way early day the first MMA fights in hoist Gracie. Mm-hmm. And he's like incredible. It's like it's like Technique. Yeah. Yeah, he was like, you know winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing It was just like this is cool Like it's like like you know, this is cool It was what martial arts were supposed to be when we were kids Yeah, when you saw Bruce Lee fuck up all these big giant guys like wow How martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you, right? Most of the time that's not real especially if they know martial arts Yes, but in the UFC when hoist Gracie off of his back was strangling Dan Severn with his legs Yeah, holy shit Yeah This guy's being pinned by this big giant wrestler and he wraps his legs around his neck Chokes him to the point the guy has to surrender. Yeah, amazing. Yeah. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, it was amazing I mean hoist got beaten up pretty bad in some of those. He did. Well, he definitely has some rough fights, but he won Yeah, he's a legend and but what it showed and I mean, I'm a huge lover of jiu-jitsu what it showed is that there is a method for for defusing these situations with technique and knowledge. Yeah, and I think it's also a great way to exercise too because It's almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing though the exercises like you want like and you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing and the analogy that I use is like if you imagine if you had a race car and You could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower. Yeah, just from your own focus and effort effort sure that's really what it's like yeah yeah but he won yeah yeah my kids I should say my I sent my kids to jiu-jitsu since there were like I don't know six Oh really yeah oh really yeah oh that's awesome yeah it's a great thing to learn it really is like a good yes yeah maybe something like sorry I mean even if you just have someone who hits the holds the pads for you you get a a workout in and it'd be fun. It really is. Yeah, it seems like a good, yes. Yeah. When am I gonna be able to buy one of them Roadsters? When's that happening? Well, I can't say exactly when, but we gotta get it, you know, this COVID thing's kinda throwing us for a loop. I'm sure. So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it certainly set us back on progress for some number of months. I'm sure. I mean, the things we gotta get done ahead of Roadster are, you know, ramping up Model Y production. That'll be a great, great car. It is a great car. Getting the Berlin Gigafactory built and also building Y, expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great. And get the, you know, the Cybertruck, Cybertruck, Semi-Truck, Roadster. Roadster's kinda like dessert. So, like, we gotta get the, you know, wheat and potatoes and greens and stuff, you know, like. But Roadster comes before Cybertruck. I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster. Interesting. I'm not mad at that. Some of the things for Roadster, they're, you know, the tri-motor, a Plaid powertrain. We're gonna have that in Model S. So that's, like, one of the ingredients that's needed for Roadster is the Plaid powertrain, the more advanced, you know, battery back, that kind of thing. I'm not mad at that. I wanted to ask you about this before I forgot. There's a company that's called Apex that's taking your Teslas and they're giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension. Sure. How do you feel about that? Do you work with them? That sounds good to me. Are you cool with those people? Yeah, I mean, I'm all for highdy, go ahead. They're jazbin' stuff up, with carbon fiber and doin' a bunch of interior choices. You're cool with, you can't fuck with that. You don't have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has, like, a sort of specialty operation? Yeah, I got no problem. That's what's it called, right? It's like, JAYMAC, is it called Apex? Yeah, I got no problem. It has, like, a sort of specialty operation. Yeah, I got no phone. That's what it's called. Yeah, I got a Unplug Performance as Apex. That's right, Unplug Performance, yeah. Yeah, you could, for sure, Unplugged performance, yeah. Yeah, you could for sure lighten the car up and improve to tire traction. Have you seen that company's stuff? What they do? I don't know specifically, but it's pretty dope. They make it pretty dope looking. They take Model S and they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. That's it right there. Cool. Ooh, la la, look at that. That looks pretty nice. Yeah, it does. Now, the Plaid version of the Model S, are you going to widen the track and do a bunch of different things? I know you guys are testing at the Nurburgring. Can you not talk about that? Yeah, it looks pretty. Well, I think we got to leave that for like a proper sort of product unveil. I understand. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. I understand. Last time you were here, you convinced me to buy a Tesla. I bought it and it's fucking insane. Oh, great. Glad you like it. Ah, man. Pretty fun. It's not just pretty fun. It's like the way I've described it is it makes other cars seem stupid. They just seem dumb. I love dumb things. I love dumb cars. I love campfires. I love campfires. I have a 1993 Porsche that's air cooled. It's not that fast. It's really slow compared to the Tesla. Yeah, it's really quite slow. But there's something engaging about the mechanical, just like the gears and it's very analog. But it's so stupid in comparison to the Tesla. Like when I want to go somewhere in the Model S, I hit the gas and it just goes, whee! It just violates time. Oh, great. Glad you like it. Ah, man. Pretty fun. I love campfires. Tesla. Really so. It's really quite slow. But just something. Yeah, you've tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah, cool. Cool. Oh, yeah. We just did a software update where it'll do a cheetah stance. So, yeah, because it's got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, cool. Cool. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, just like a sprinter, basically. Like what do you do if you're a sprinter? You hunker down and then... So, I shaved like a tenth of a second off the 0.60. I mean, like, you know, it's pretty fun. It's so, I've taken so many people and I'm like, I take them for the holy shit moment. I'm like, are you ready? Like, hang on there. Then I stomp on the gas, then I stomp on the gas. Then I've never felt anything like it. It's confusing. Yeah. It really is. Sure. The instant torque, the instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling. Sure. It's baffling. It's baffling. They've never felt it. No. It's faster than falling. It's crazy. It's so fast. It's a roller coaster. Yeah. And my family yells at me when I stomp the gas like I tell my kids, I'm like, do you want to feel it? You want to feel it? Do it, do it, do it. My wife's like, don't do it. Boom! What! Yeah. And even if I just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, it's very exciting. It's very fun. It's like having a... Boom! What! What! Yeah, that's very fun. It's very it's like having a roller coaster on tap. You know it really is like a roller coaster on top Yeah, without the loop-de-loops, but it's the the pinning to your seat It seems like you're not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a can you know a consumer vehicle that you can Just a regular person could buy if you have the money it seems too too crazy And then the idea this roadster is a half of a second faster than that Yeah, that's madness. Well if that roads with the roadster. We're gonna do some things that are kind of unfair, so We're gonna take some things from like You know from kind of like rocket rocket world and put them on a car so oh, I read about that explain that like What do you well like I said? We can't okay unveil right here, but but it's gonna do some things that aren't fair, and then They're the the the where we do the unveil the roadster let me just say that anyone who's been waiting They won't be sorry It's they won't be sorry Sure well anything that goes 0 to 60 was it 1.9. Is that the zero 60? That's the base model. That's What's the top of the food chain model? Okay? Okay? Faster than that just say faster than that yeah that seems so crazy to me now What was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window, and they were supposed to not break and it broke okay? Okay, you know faster than that. Let's just say faster than that well Yeah, I know Are you know you know that our demos are authentic? So I was not expecting that and I and then I think I muttered under my breath Yeah Yeah, you didn't get mad though. No. You didn't Steve Jobs it No, I I definitely swore but you know I didn't think the mic could pick it up, but it did and but it's so Like we practiced this you know by in the scenes yeah Tesla we don't do we don't do like tons of practice for for our demos because we Work, we're working on the cars like we you know we're building new technologies and and improving the fundamental product So we're not spending it like doing like hundreds of you know practice things or anything like that. We don't have time for that but the Just hours before that the demo Both Franz you know is that head of design and I were in the studio at the thrown steel balls at the window I was bouncing right off. I'm like okay. This seems pretty good seems like we got it, okay and then we think what happened was that when we When Franz hit the the the door with the sledgehammer you know so sure like like this is this is like exoskeleton You know high-strength hardened steel you can literally Take wind up with a sledgehammer. You know full-on Double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door, and there's not even a dent. It's cool But we think that that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then Once you crack the corner of the glass that you just game over so Then when you threw the bowl that that's what cracked the glass so in Go through that's true It didn't shatter the whole thing like a regular window would either which would just dissolve right so in hindsight The ball should have been first sledgehammer second. Yeah, yeah, you live you learn. Yeah, exactly listen man We've taken up a lot of your time you had a child. Yeah, I got a recently Amazing that you had the time to come down here, and I really appreciate that I appreciate everything you do man I'm glad you're out there, and I really appreciate you coming down here and sharing your perspective. Yeah, I gotta get back to it Well, I think you got a great show. Thanks for having me on. Thank you. My pleasure pleasure Elon Musk ladies and gentlemen good night", "Episode Title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk", "Date": "2020-05-07T13:00:07Z", "URL": "www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8", "Guest": "Elon Musk"}, {"text": "Joe Rogan podcast, check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. So your new Oculus is awesome. It's very impressive. Yeah, it's very cool. Coming out in October, we're going to be talking about it at our Connect conference that's coming up. Yeah, pretty excited about it. It's um, it's so interesting the the when you put it on so i'll just describe it to people When I put it on there was an avatar in front of me And it was an alien woman and the alien woman when I moved my mouse She moved her mouth when I moved my eyes left and right. She's tracking my eyes when I make like a angry face like It makes an angry face when you go like oh, it's incredible. It's like  You can see the evolution and the progress of this stuff where it's getting to the point where it's mimicking human patterns in a kind of a creepy way. But it's very cool. Yeah, so, you know, for me, this stuff is all about, like, helping people connect, right? I mean, the way that I got into this is, you know, I don't know, I just started thinking about, like, what is the  Like, what would be the ultimate expression of basically people using technology to feel present with each other? And it's not phones. It's not computers. Like, how do you get this sensation of actually being present, like you're right there with another person? And that's, to me, what virtual and eventually augmented reality are all about. And there's just this whole technology roadmap that you  that we basically just need to go run down over the next decade to unlock that. So for the next device that's coming out in October, there are a few big features. I mean, the one that you're talking about, basically social presence. I mean, the ability to now have kind of eye contact in virtual reality, have your face be tracked so that way  Your avatar, it's not just like this still thing, but if you smile or if you frown or if you pout or, you know, whatever your expression is, have that actually just in real time translate to your avatar. I mean, that's obviously like our facial expressions are just a huge, that's like a, you know, there's more nonverbal communication when people are with each other than verbal communication. You had a really good point, too, about face tracking. If you're doing a FaceTime call, that you don't look at each other in the eye. Because you're looking at the camera to look in the eye, and then you don't see the person. So if you look at the camera, you're looking up. And if you look down at the actual screen, you're not making eye contact with the person. But this is able to recreate actual eye contact. Yeah, no, this will be the first time really to do that. You know, I mean, when we're using technology today, I mean, it's great to be able to make phone calls and video calls and all that. I mean, if you can't be with someone today, it's nice to be able to see their face. But when you're on a video call, you don't actually feel like you're there with the person, right? I mean, you get some signals, some information, you can see their face, but the whole time you're  you're kind of trying to convince your brain that you're actually there with them, but your brain knows, right? It's like at kind of like a deep level that you're not actually there with them. You're just getting some information about what they look like. And to me, what virtual reality unlocks is it basically really convinces your brain that you're there. I mean, when you're in there,  You have to basically try to convince your brain that this isn't real, right, and that you're not present. And there are all these just subtle signals and things that either deepen the illusion or break it, that each time we do a new version, we just try to  you know, break down a few more of the barriers. And one of the big ones early on, well, the first one, obviously, was just like having a headset and be able to look around. And for that, one of the key things that your eye basically refreshes, I don't know, call it every five milliseconds or something. So if you turn your head,  and the image isn't kind of refreshed to where you're looking within five milliseconds, then there's this huge mismatch between your visual system and your vestibular system and your kind of balance in your ear. And people used to kind of feel uncomfortable from that, right? Because it's like a physical discomfort because it like what you were looking at didn't match kind of as you were rotating your head. So that was kind of the first thing. Then we got hands. And there's this whole thing that was super interesting there, where at first we wanted to display your whole arm, which makes sense, right? Because you'd think, okay, it's a little weird to just see your hand. But it turns out that your brain is perfectly willing to just accept seeing your hand without your arm. Because your hand is the thing that it's trying to manipulate. And as a matter of fact, if we kind of interpolated and got your arm position wrong, right? So we'd get into these cases where your hands were here, and we'd sort of guess that your arm was like that or something. And if your arm was actually like that, but we displayed it so that it was in like that, you're like, ah, my elbow's broken. It felt like really wrong. So it's actually much better to show a limited number of signals, but get them right. And then you can just add on over time. So for previous versions before this, the kind of eye contact was all just AI simulated, but we didn't actually know when you were making eye contact because we weren't tracking the eyes. And now for this version, and hopefully  a lot of the different ones that we build going forward, you'll be able to have realistic facial expressions and more translated directly to your avatar. But there's this whole roadmap of basically how do you deliver this real sense of presence, like you're there with another person no matter where you actually are. It was very impressive because even when I moved my jaw side to side like It did that it made the Oh face like whoo. It's it's really interesting and you know, you were saying also that what what this the way this is tracking is You're you're doing this without putting something on your body without putting trackers on your body But do you ultimately think that that's like are we gonna go ready player one? We have like a haptic feedback suit and  and you have to zip this thing up to get into a game, and in that way, you're going to be fully immersive? Or do you think that it can get to the point where it can mimic the movements of your body accurately without you having to wear something? So I think that there will be opportunities to wear things to augment the experience further, right? So we already have these experiments with haptic gloves where you can, like,  if you touch a digital object, right? If you drop a ball from one hand to the other, you can feel the ball in your hand physically. And that's pretty cool. But I want to design this in a way where you don't need that, right? So today, there's two primary modes of doing the tracking. I mean, there's this kind of notion of inside-out tracking. You're wearing the headset, and it tracks your motion. It tracks your hands. Eventually, it'll track your legs with an AI model. And you can do that all with your headset. And the big advantage of that is you don't need to have a whole lot of different devices, right? Eventually, you'll be able to do it without even having controllers. You'll just have the headset. The headset will get smaller. It'll be more portable. You'll be able to bring it around. You don't want to have a setup that has like 10 pieces, right? I mean, maybe there are going to be times when you want to kind of have that  sort of super deep experience, or maybe you have it at your home. But I think ultimately, people are going to just want to have versions of this that they can bring around. And whether it's on an airplane, or you're doing work at the office, or you're going to a coffee shop or whatever. And for that, you really just want to make it work from the device. So just from a pair of glasses or something along those lines? Yeah, I mean, right now, there's kind of two  The concepts of virtual reality and augmented reality are sort of on two different development paths, but they're obviously fundamentally interrelated. So virtual reality, it's kind of possible to build today. Quest 2, it's pretty popular, doing well. Hopefully the new one that comes out, I think it's a pretty big step above it. But you can build that today. There's a lot of new technology that we've researched that goes into that. But it also is building on top of decades of advances in displays that came from TVs and then laptops and phones. And some of the display technology gets to piggyback on those decades of innovation and all these different companies that have done that work before. AR is a pretty different beast because what you really want to get to is not a headset. You want to get to something that's like a normal looking pair of glasses that is  It won't be like a wireframe because you'll need to fit some electronics in it where you'll basically need to have a computer in there and speakers and a microphone and batteries and a laser projector. And then the display, which we and a lot of other folks think is going to be this technology called waveguides. Which it's completely different from screens because it's a screen. It's like you're looking at a thing And and basically you're looking at like all the pixels that are on the screen The thing that's that's different about a wave guide is it'll actually be see-through So you'll be able to see the world through it and then it'll display holograms And be able to place them at different depths in the world. So as a wave guide a type of technology Like what is a wave guide? Yeah, it's basically, they can be made of different substances, plastic, glass, different substrates, and they basically get etched or printed in different ways, and there's this big debate right now  where a lot of the research is going into what is the right way to basically create these waveguides that have the right properties. Because you want, for augmented reality, to get something that's wide enough field of view. So you can imagine in five years, we're having this conversation. I'm not here. You're wearing AR glasses. Hologram Mark is here. And so it's not only just is it kind of working as a hologram, but there's all these different dimensions beyond. just being like a better video chat. If we wanted to play poker, you know, it's like I could, you know, I could like deal a deck of cards and we could play a hologram. Me could, you know, deal hologram cards and you could have your glasses and physically you there could pick up the hologram cards and you can have a poker night where like some of your friends are there physically and some of them are there as holograms. And it's actually kind of wild. One of the thought experiments that I like to do is,  thinking about how few of the things that we physically have in the world actually need to be physical. You know, obviously things like chairs need to be physical, right? You're not gonna be sitting on a hologram. Food needs to be physical. But most entertainment type stuff, I mean, not just cards, but games, most media, TVs in the future probably won't need to actually be physical things. It'll just be like an app, like a  We'll just have an app there on your wall and it's like, snap your fingers, get the hologram there for the TV and we can have our glasses and watch whatever you want there. And I don't know, they're sort of limited to being rectangular now because a bunch of  you know, limits in terms of the physics of how they get produced. But in the future, you'll just have, like, some, you know, high school students or college students developing apps, and it'll just be wild. Like, crazy stuff will just kind of get created. But so, yeah, so you'll eventually be able to kind of have that all come through these AR glasses. So are there these AR glasses, are they in production now? Are they in development now? Like when you talk about this kind of technology where you can see things that aren't there and look at maps and watch videos and have it all on a small computer that's in a frame of glasses, do they exist already? No.  I think we'll start to get stuff that kind of looks like the full version of this over the next, I'd say,  three to five years, but I think it'll also start off pretty expensive once it's available, and then it'll take a while to work down to something that's like hundreds of dollars. There are versions of this that you can start to see if you relax some of the constraints, right? So the kind of ultimate AR experience is that, like, okay, you just have normal-looking glasses that can kind of have all of these, have holograms and make it so you can interact with people wherever you want. If you relax the form factor constraint, right, so you have a headset instead of normal looking glasses, that's the other thing that's coming in the new device that we're shipping in October is mixed reality in VR, right? So we got to play around with this a little bit in the sword fighting experience that we did. You know, basically, the thing about mixed reality is you see the physical world around you. In the context of VR, it's not happening through a waveguide. It's basically happening through, you have cameras on the device that capture the world and then translate that in real time into stereo images, so different images in both eyes, so that way you can, because otherwise it's weird and we kind of see stuff. 3D, because our two eyes see slightly different things. The computers are putting that together on the fly. And then you can overlay digital objects on top of that. So when we were sword fighting, it's like the version of me and my sword, it's like that was a digital thing, but otherwise it was in your lobby, right? And you could see your lobby. So you could start to see those kind of AR experiences starting to get built, but in a form factor around mixed reality VR first. So that's one direction that I think that the industry is exploring. The other is basically looking at, OK, so we've got to constrain this form factor because we want to have something that looks like normal glasses. What's the most technology that we can fit into a pair of normal-looking glasses today? So you kind of go from both sides. It's like, what's the experience that we want to have, even if we can't get the form factor right? and what's the best we can do with the form factor, and then each year those two basically converge. But on the smart glasses side, we work with Ray-Ban to basically build these smart glasses, and they're the best-selling smart glasses that have ever been built. We're continuing to work on new versions of it, but basically you can get a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarers now that have a microphone and they have a speaker and they can take photos and take videos and you can post them to Instagram. They do it on voice command? Yep. Oh, so you can say take a photo of this? Yep, take a photo, take a video. And what kind of image quality are you getting off of these things? It's pretty good. I want to make sure I don't get the spec wrong and I just have all these different numbers in my head because I want to make sure I don't confuse it with the new version. Is it similar to a selfie camera? Yeah, yeah. Limited in comparison to the back camera? Yeah. No, it's not quite as good as the back cameras today, but yeah. You look at the quality and it's good. And it fits in the corner of glasses. Does that bring about privacy concerns? If people could just like start filming things? Yeah, so I mean we designed it so it has a light on it. So whenever... I mean that I think is actually a really important part of this. Could you put a piece of tape over the light? I mean, I guess in theory, but it's, um, yeah, there it is. So that little thing in the corner, is that a highlight or a light? No, that's the light. That's the light. And it blinks, and it's a pretty active indicator. And I think if you put a piece of tape over it, it would probably interfere with the camera. And so those wavefarers are essentially the same size as normal wavefarers? Do they have thicker arms? I think it's ever so slightly thicker, but it's within the same ballpark of weight. Ray-Bans are some of the most popular and successful glasses, and part of the reason why I wanted to work with them is because they know a lot about glasses design, and that's not my thing. So I figure, OK, they'll really bring to the table some constraints around like, OK, how big can this actually be before it starts getting too heavy on your face and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time? And I've just learned a ton working with those guys. I mean, they're super sharp. They're this great Italian company. And the collaboration has been awesome so far. So I'm looking forward to building more stuff with them. But yeah, so you basically have these two paths to the technology at once. You're kind of trying to explore  all the capabilities but in a device that's bigger than the form factor that you want, while simultaneously, every year or two, cranking and pumping more technology into what can you fit into the form factor that you want. you know, make it a really great design. And then just eventually these things converge. And then eventually they'll converge, and you'll get the functionality, and you'll get the kind of form factor, but it'll still be kind of expensive for a little while. And then you fast forward a few years from there, and then I think it'll really be a mainstream thing. But even VR today is doing quite well. I mean, I don't think we've released, like, exact numbers on the sales, but it's within the ballpark of, you know, Xbox or PlayStation or those kind of platforms. Really? Yeah, so I mean, we started off, this was sort of my theory on this is like, all right, gaming is use case number one for VR. But then pretty quickly, if you look at any platform, right, so computers, phones before, games are a huge part of those platforms. But if you look at the main things that people do, it's really about communication, because I mean, this is what people do, right? It's like we communicate. And, you know, that's kind of how we get meaning in our life is interacting with other people. So I was like, all right, that's going to happen with VR. And sure enough, if you look at the top apps in VR now, the top few are basically social, metaverse, hang out with your friends apps that are not centered around any specific game. So that kind of hypothesis around, OK, VR is starting to add different use cases, it's going from games first. Games are still growing and going to be huge. Just kind of social, hang out with friends, be present. And we're getting all these other use cases that are kind of crazy and are happening sooner than I thought. So, you know, another big one is fitness, right? Just because, I mean, in a way, I mean, these are like the first physical computing platforms. It's like, you don't move around while you're on your computer. I guess you could a little bit on your phone, but it's sort of awkward because you're looking at the small screen. VR and eventually AR are really designed to be able to move around and do things and interact with the world. And that's really important to me. I hate sitting in front of a desk. I just feel like if I'm not active, I'm wasting my day. So I don't know. There have been these awesome experiences. Basically, a couple of companies, you can kind of think about it like Peloton for VR, where it's like Peloton, they sell you the bike or the treadmill, and then you buy the subscription and you get the classes. There's a couple of companies that basically do cardio, they do dancing, they do boxing. But instead of having to buy a bike, you just have your Quest headset. And once you have that, you buy a subscription to these companies. And you can just take lessons and do different things and fitness. I thought that was pretty wild. I thought that in the long term, something like that would start to happen. But it happened way sooner than I thought, which was really cool to see. Well, if you do one of the boxing games, you realize right away, this is a really good workout. The virtual boxer, when they come towards you and they're in that ring and they start throwing punches at you and you move in your head, you really wind up getting a really high heart rate. You put out a lot of energy. It's really good cardio. I found my feet would hurt. Because I was pivoting and moving so much, because I was constantly switching stances and trying to get away from punches. And as you get further on in some of the games, the opponents become more difficult. It's really exciting. It's fun. And you get out of there, and you're really exhausted. It's a really good workout. Yeah. And that's just the kind of nature of the whole platform. And that's one of the things that I love about it. But those aren't even...  trying to be fitness apps, right? Yeah, it's just that they just happen to be physical. Are they capable of having two people, like we had a fencing match today, you and I did, which was really fun. Are they capable of doing that with boxing now? Where two people have a, because the thing about the fencing match that we had that I thought was really interesting was like you were facing one direction, like 30 feet away, and I was facing another direction. Like we weren't even facing each other. It didn't even matter. So you could be in Bangladesh, and I can be in Rome, and we could be playing a game together. Yeah, so, I mean, the fencing demo, our internal team built, because we haven't released the new device yet, so in order to kind of make stuff work for it, we kind of built it ourselves. But the boxing ones are made all by other game developers and different developers. And they can do that? Yeah, there's nothing stopping them from having a multiplayer mode. I'm not sure if any of them do yet. All the ones that I've played, I mean, I do Thrill the Fight, and I really like Creed. But I do those as...  as single player. I don't know if they have multiplayer modes, but there's nothing holding them back from doing that. So I'd imagine that they will add that over time. It seems like a smart move. I mean, we were talking about martial arts, like in terms like Muay Thai and other. I think jujitsu would be a real problem, but because you'd have to physically have something to resist against. But if you could figure out how to do a Muay Thai mode where  The only problem would be things change when you make contact with stuff Yeah things change in terms of like Positioning and movement and what you're able to get away with and not get away with whereas with boxing Boxing is pretty good for that like it's probably like the best combat sport for VR Because you don't even have to hit anything for to feel like you kind of are and when you get hit with a jab your your screen lights up you feel like you got hit and Yeah, I mean, for kicking, with punching, it's a little easier to throw a punch and then just pull it back. With kicking, if you're not hitting a pad or something, you want to, like, continue rotating, or else it's tough to really put your weight into it. Do you envision a world where one day the physical experience of the game is going to be inconsequential because everything is going to be taking place in your mind? It'll be so good, whether it's with haptic feedback or some other kind of input, where you'll be able to actually experience very Matrix-like something that's not there. Is that ultimately where all this is going? I don't know. I just think that so much of our experience is our body and not just our mind. I mean, there's this strain of kind of philosophical thought that's like, okay, what is a human? It's really just your brain, right? And I don't subscribe to that at all because, I mean, I don't know how you feel about stuff, but I just feel like my whole energy level and mood and kind of how I kind of interact with the world is all just based on, it's like,  it's so physical, right? It's not just, you know, so I don't, I mean, I guess maybe over time it would be possible to just simulate that through your brain, but I don't believe that we're just brains in tanks or just brains in a body. I kind of think our kind of physical being and the actions that we take there are as much, or I don't know, that's like just as much of kind of the experience of being human  I would agree to that, but I would also say that a lot of people just like to sit down and watch movies, and that's a very alien experience to the human body, and it's something we've become very accustomed to. So what I'm thinking is if technology advances and it keeps going further in the direction that it's headed now, more immersive, more convincing, that uncanny valley gets bridged and all of a sudden you have a real life experience  Now, whether this is through some sort of neural link type deal or some new technology that tricks the mind into actual experiences. Ultimately, isn't that where this is all going to go, where you're going to be able to have experiences without having them? That's not to negate the beauty of real experiences or not to say we won't have real experiences anymore. But if you wanted to have a real experience, and we talked about economic restrictions that would keep you from being able to fly to another part of the world, well, you could go there with your Oculus. You could have a very realistic 3D representation of those places. Like, you took me to Rome today. I got to see Rome. It's very cool. But do you think that ultimately that is going to get to a time where the technology is so advanced that it's indiscernible? That you could have a podcast experience with me. You and I could have this same conversation right now, but neither one of us be in this room. Yeah. I think the nature of technology is that ... I think it's  It's interesting to sort of hypothesize what the kind of extreme end state is going to be when something becomes kind of all-consuming. But I think the normal way this stuff plays out is that some things are more easily mimicable or replaceable than others. So we were talking before about, okay, boxing, yeah, you can do that pretty well. Maybe one day we'll get Muay Thai and kicking in. Jiu-Jitsu, that's gonna be pretty hard, right? Because you need like all kinds of resistance. So, I mean, I think the way that this progresses is like,  it'll keep on being able to do more things really well. And I would guess that there will be other technologies or other things will advance in the world that will prevent any one thing from ever subsuming everything else. So, I don't know. I mean, I also, I mean, maybe just because I'm in the position of like,  working on building this stuff every day, so maybe it's just, it's like, I'm just trying to make it useful for a lot of things, right? So to jump to like, it's so useful that it's better than everything is like, is sort of, yeah, I'm just not. I mean, that's so far ahead of where we actually are, because I'm like in the trenches every day trying to get this to work. Maybe too close to it. Yeah. But from a bird's eye view, like if you looked at where this is going, it's going to become more immersive, right? It's going to get better. It's going to be more convincing. And this is the real argument for simulation theory, right? The argument for simulation theory is if there's so many civilizations out there in the universe and they're so advanced, ultimately one has to create a simulation. It seems like that's going to happen. If the human race could survive another 100,000 years, the odds we wouldn't create a really realistic simulation is probably pretty low. Yeah, I think the question is just how realistic and how good. To me, the holy grail is building something that can create a sense of human presence. I've spent the last almost 20 years of my life building social software. making it so that you, whatever limited computation you have, you can kind of share something about your experience. And, you know, it started off with primarily text, right, when I was in college. Then we all got these smartphones and cameras. So then it became a lot of photos. Now the mobile networks are good enough that it's starting to be a lot more video. And to me, this kind of like immersive experience is clearly going to be the next step. But there's this question about, okay, So being able to feel like you're present with someone will unlock so many different types of value for a lot of people. And there's like social and entertainment, there's professional. I mean, one of, you know, I follow this economist who basically studies that economic opportunity and upward mobility is sort of limited or varies based on like what zip code you grow up in, right? Because there's different opportunities in different places. Imagine if you didn't have to move to some city that didn't have your values in order to be able to get all the economic opportunities. That would be awesome. So in the future, where you can just use AR, VR, and teleport in the morning to the office and show up as a hologram, I think that's going to be pretty sweet. It'll unlock a lot of economic opportunity for a lot of people. Is it ever going to be 100% as good as being there in person? Probably not. But like, I mean, I don't know, when we were talking about about doing this conversation, you know, we talked on the phone, right? It's like, I didn't fly down to Austin to talk about whether to have this conversation. Sometimes it's like, like, whatever amount of simulation you have is,  you can create a lot of value even if it's not 100% as good as the actual physical thing. So I just view our job as, you know, we'll basically approach that like an asymptote. I don't know, Phil, you know, you'll never be able to do all of the things that you can do kind of in person with a person. But you'll just be able to do more and more. If today it's gaming or hanging out, over the next few years it'll be working. So hopefully you'll just be able to teleport in and basically just show up as a hologram and work remotely and live wherever you want, be with your family wherever they live, but just be able to show up in whatever place. I think that that's gonna be pretty awesome and I think we'll be able to do that pretty well. It's gonna be a real issue for commercial real estate. There's not going to be a lot of offices. If that actually becomes as good as having a cell phone in your pocket and being able to make a phone call, you could just sort of teleport to work. It's going to be a problem. No one's going to want to work. Well, that's a different question. I mean, whether or not they're going to physically want to be there, rather. Maybe they'll want to work, but they're not going to want to go to the office. Yeah, I mean, maybe, although I think being physically, being present with people, feeling a sense of presence is pretty important, regardless of where you do it. I mean, I've found over the last couple of years, the way that stuff, that the work has been done has changed a huge amount. And there are all these things that are sort of complex about the office. But I mean, I see people in person almost every day. Sometimes I probably do more meetings at my house now than I would have before. But yeah, I don't know. I do think that seeing people in person having that sense of presence makes a big difference. I think so too, but there's definitely a big pushback now about people going to the office rather than working from home. People would rather just do their work from home, and they're like, with the internet connections as they are today, and the ability to video conference, why do I have to be physically in the building in order to get my work done? Yeah, no, and I agree with that too. You know, our company is actually pretty forward leaning on remote work. I mean, just especially some types of work, especially software engineering, you can do pretty well from a lot of different places. And if you're an engineer, sometimes it's actually better to not be in the office because then people aren't bugging you. You kind of want like a block of like five hours where you can just work on a problem. I don't know, it's like, I have this thing where, you know, I'll be like in zone, kind of flow concentration working on something, and you know, my wife will like ask me some like basic question, and I'll just be like, oh man, it's like I just like lost my flow, and it's like, and like from her perspective, it's like, oh, not a big deal, it was a quick question, just go back to what you were doing. It's like, no, that's not how it works. But it's, so I do think to some degree, having people be able to work remotely  is actually pretty useful for a lot of things, but I think we'll need to find this mix. I think we'll need to find the mix. I physically run away from my wife when I have a joke idea. If she's talking and I have an idea, I'll just run away. I just go, I got an idea. She gets it, so it's okay. But yeah, if I'm in the middle of writing and she comes in and interrupts, it's over. Yeah. Just gets shattered. So in some ways, well, you would have to have like a real quiet and secure place. But I think for a lot of people, just the wasted time commuting and all that, if you could eliminate that through AR or VR, some sort of a hologram system, just the stress of life would be so much better. Yeah. I mean, that's been for me over the last couple of years with COVID and just kind of rethinking the way that stuff  has worked, I think reducing the commute has been one of the big efficiencies. But also being able to live in different places has been nice. I mean, I spent a lot of time down in Kauai earlier on, and I got really into surfing and hydrofoiling. And I just wake up in the morning and go do that, and then just be really refreshed and go do my full day of meetings, which is obviously not something I could do in Palo Alto. So, I don't know, I'm pretty positive on all this. I think if you can give people the ability to get their kind of fluid state, like flow state work remotely, but then also just be able to kind of in a second teleport to a place and show up as a hologram and be present, I think that's pretty valuable. Now, that doesn't replace everything, right? I mean, one of the things that I found is  For larger meetings, one of the most useful things is not actually the meeting itself, it's just getting a chance to catch up with people before and after the meeting, when you're in the hallway or something. So, yeah, there's a downside to being so efficient about being able to teleport in and out, too, because you can miss some of those casual downtime moments. But overall, yeah, I think it's going to create this crazy amount of efficiency there. Yeah, I think people are still going to crave real world experiences no matter what. Obviously, I do stand-up comedy, so obviously that experience, you must be there. That's part of the fun, is being in the room with people. But I can envision technology improving to the point where you could create a virtual comedy club. and you would see all the different people that have the headsets on in the room, and you would probably get pretty close. There was a lot of people that did Zoom stand up during the pandemic, and it was awful, because there was no audience. They were just basically doing their act with no crowd. Don't do that. Don't do that. Yeah, you need the feedback. It's terrible. It's super awkward just doing public speaking and not having any feedback. Well, if someone's just doing public feedback, there's some really great podcasts where people just, like Bill Burr, just talks to himself. It's just him ranting about life and stuff, and it's great. He doesn't necessarily need someone to bounce off of. But comedy is a different thing. Comedy by itself with no audience is not good. Yeah. So there actually, there is already at least one experience like this that I'm aware of. So we have this Horizon social platform and people can build worlds in it. And it's like, it's pretty simple today, but it's designed to be this really easy world building platform and people can go in and build stuff. And people built this thing called the Soapstone Comedy Club. And this is actually one of the stories that I've heard of people using VR that I think is really touching. So there's this woman who basically lost her son and was really sad and was grieving for a while. And comedy was just a really important outlet for her, but she had a lot of social anxiety around going and physically being in front of people and performing and doing it at a club. So, she started doing it at the Soapstone Comedy Club and had a little bit more anonymity because it was in virtual reality, but she could feel a real sense of presence of other people there. And, I mean, talking to her about it, it's been a real important  experience for her to kind of be this creative outlet and help her get over this grieving that she's had. And it's not something maybe that she would have been comfortable having the kind of full intensity experience of a physical comedy club, but you kind of got a bunch of the way there by feeling like you were present with people there. Hmm My friend Brian red band. He does this thing called virtual red band where what does he do? It does like they go to diners and stuff like that. They set it up VR chat Yeah, so he does it in oculus and he you know Has a bunch of his friends log on at the same time and they go into a room together and hang out it's really interesting because I think that  They're like to be able to have an online community where you go to a place and you all meet up and you're all like talking and hearing each other's voices. Yeah. And seeing the avatar moving like that alien avatar that you showed me today. It's very real looking. I mean, I clearly see that it's this animated thing, but I would liken it to an avatar from the movie Avatar, like the Na'vi. There's something cool about it where it's definitely a step above a lot of these things that I've seen in the past. That it's moving into this much more realistic sort of place where I could imagine a lot of people just deciding, like, today I'm going to be a penguin. I'm going to go to this diner and hang out with these guys as a penguin. And it's exciting. It's kind of fun. And part of what's a little trippy about it is that in some ways, some of these experiences, I think, feel more realistic than, for example, having a Zoom call, right, where you can actually see the person's face. Because, I mean, the way that our memory works, it's like, it's very spatial, right? So, you know, when I leave here today, I'll remember that you were across from me, and there's a symmetry, right? It's like, you're across from me, so that means I'm across from you. We have a shared memory of kind of the space of the place. And, you know, Well, I guess it doesn't quite work because of the headphones. But normally, if you talk, it's coming from that direction. And spatial audio and kind of directional, building a spatial model of things is how we make memories. So you take something like Zoom, and it just completely blows that up. Because now, it's every meeting that you have looks the same. And also, there's no symmetry, right? So if you're in the top left of my box square, that doesn't mean that I'm in the same place for you. So we actually don't have any kind  shared spatial sense of that. And I don't know if you've had this experience, but I just kind of feel like if I do a day of Zoom calls, they all sort of blend together and I have a hard time remembering what meeting someone said something in. Whereas then, you know, if you go into VR,  It's like, OK, you have an avatar. It's obviously not super realistic yet. It'll get better and better over time as the computation gets better. Although, as an aside, I'm not actually convinced that even when we have photorealistic avatars that people are going to prefer that to the expressive ones. But that's kind of a whole separate tangent that we can go down. I think you'll clearly want the ability to do both, have a photorealistic one and an expressive one. But yeah, I mean, if you're sitting around and someone's a penguin or your friends are clearly cartoony, but you're sitting around a table and you have a shared sense of space and your friend is to your right, which means that you're to their left. And when they speak, you hear it coming from that direction. You actually remember the spatial sense of that in the same way that you would a physical thing, which it's just kind of getting all those details right over time. I just think that there's, I mean, this to me, this is like some of the most exciting work that I've gotten to do in a while, because I just feel like building social experiences on phones is so constrained, right? In some ways, it's awesome, because there's like billions of people that have phones. So I can, you know, we can build services that get used by billions of people around the world. And that's obviously rewarding in its own way too. But like, having the ability to  define what these next platforms are going to be, and have them break out of these boxes that have been really weirdly defined, right, in terms of, like, these things, phones, computers, they were not designed for, for basically communication and interaction, they were designed for kind of work and, and certain computational workloads. And so a lot of what I'm trying to do is like, okay, well,  What does it look like to design the next computing platform in a way that's really people-centric? So if you were doing it in the way that our brains worked and how we actually process the world and how we think about stuff and what matters to us, I don't think you'd build a platform that was designed around apps. You'd build it where the fundamental  a unit of how you interact is around kind of people and how you express yourself. And you'd want to be able to like have an avatar and expression of your identity and be able to just jump between a bunch of different experiences rather than have everything be so siloed. So I think that this is it's just like it's a it's pretty wild to try to build this all from the ground up because it's just this incredible breadth and an amount of technology. And I mean, I often get criticized because we're we're investing just this huge amount in this. We're going to spend  This year alone, more than $10 billion on on all of these different research streams. But the breadth of this is just like, extremely wide, right? It's not like $10 billion is going towards any one specific thing. It's like, there's all the avatar work and all of how you express yourself and how you build the worlds. And then there's all the VR stuff. And within VR, we're working on this year's device, and next year's device, and the one after that. And then in AR, we talked about, let's say we have the Ray-Ban glasses, and we have sort of the next version of that. But then we also have kind of the research going towards the full AR. And we haven't even gotten to neural interfaces yet, but we should definitely spend some time on that. But it's like you kind of go across all these different things, and it's just this incredibly wide amount of technology that needs to get built in order to basically build  and deliver a realistic sense of presence like you're physically there with another person, which I just think is the most magical thing in the world. Well, it's very exciting. The idea that you could have an office in a jungle, like you could just all of a sudden, we're going to call this meeting together and we're going to be on the moon. We're going to be next to a volcano. There's going to be a bubbling volcano right next to the desk. It's cool. Look, I love the fact that there's people like you out there doing it, that it's expanding the possibilities for this stuff. So neural interfaces, what are your thoughts on that? Where is that going and where are we at right now? Yeah, so go back to your comments about the matrix before. I think when people think about neural interfaces, or any interface, I think it's important to separate out their sort of  There's feedback that you're giving to the computer, and then there's information that the computer gives to you. And you can separate those two things out. So I actually think the super hard part here is going to be having a computer give you information straight into your brain, and that's not a thing that we're working on. So, some people, I mean, like Elon with Neuralink and those companies, I think it's, I mean, that's just taking this, like, super far off. I mean, maybe it'll be ready in, like, a couple decades. And there will probably be interesting use cases in the near term for people who have injuries or something like that. But I think, you know, normal people, I think, in the next 10 or 15 years are probably not going to want to get something just installed in their brain for fun, is my guess. I don't want to be an early adopter. Yeah, I think you want the mature version of that, not the one where it's going to get a lot better next year and you need to get your brain implant upgraded every year. But here's the version of this that I spend a lot of time thinking about. So you have AR glasses, right? And how are you going to control them? How you control any computation device is obviously super fundamental to what the platform is. So you have a bunch of different modes. You know, one of them is going to be voice, right? You'll be able to talk to it. But that doesn't always work, right? If you're in a public place or you want to be discreet or you want to just not annoy the people around you, you're not going to want to dictate everything out loud. A second way is going to be using your hands. So let's say, OK, snap my fingers. We have a chess game or a poker game. And OK, here's our chess board, and I move a piece. It's like, OK, yeah, that'll do with my hands. That's kind of cool. But you're not going to be walking down the sidewalk, manipulating stuff with your hands. Minority reports. Yeah, I mean, I think at some basic level, if you can get past that just being weird, I think most people's hands will just get tired. If you hold your hands out like this for a long enough period of time, eventually you want to put your hands down. So the question is, how do you make it so that you can basically go and have your mind give commands to the computer, in this case the glasses,  without having to speak out loud, without having to wave your hands around, even though those things will be great for some use cases, you're not going to want them all the time. So the research that we're doing, it's based on the, it's basically it's input only, and it's focused on, so it's not It's not trying to send signals to your brain. It's trying to make it so that your brain can communicate with the computer. And the path that we have is it's based on the fact that we have all these extra motor neurons in our body, right? And part of the reason for that is like in case you get hurt, you have neuroplasticity, you can rewire, do stuff. like, find a different pathway to kind of send a signal to move your finger or something. There's all these different ways that it turns out our brain could tell this finger to move, but we've sort of optimized individually. We kind of reinforce certain pathways and end up using one kind of motor neuron pathway to do a specific thing, and you have all these others that are not that used. So it turns out you can have a device on your wrist  that basically your brain can communicate with your hand, tell your hand to move in like a pattern that it isn't used to, and then the wristband can sort of pick up those signals and translate them into completely different things, like having a virtual hand move in front of you while your physical hand is just kind of sitting there at your side. So, you'll be able to have this experience in the future where, like, you're sitting in a meeting, and, you know, your wife texts you, and it pops up in the corner of your glasses, and you want to respond, but you don't want to, like, pull out your phone, because that's kind of rude, right? So you just kind of, like, I don't know, twitch your wrist a little bit, maybe like this, like some super discreet motion that no one even knows you're doing it, and you just, like, send a message. That seems like a massive distraction. I mean, people are already distracted by their phones. Like when people get a text message and they're like, hang on a second, I just can't answer this real quick. And you're like, okay. And you're sitting there having lunch with someone and they're not talking to you anymore because they're looking at their phone. But now they're going to be looking at these AR glasses and just thinking out text messages. And you won't even know that they're distracted. They're just going to be not connecting with you. I don't know. I actually think  I don't know, one experience that I think has been interesting since I've been doing more Zoom calls, especially earlier in COVID, one thing that I think actually was quite good, or is quite good, is the ability to both kind of have everyone who you're meeting with on video chat, but then also have a chat thread going with some of those people. So that way, like, let's say there's something that you don't want to say to everyone who's in the room, but you want to ask one person, it's like, hey,  Can you clarify this thing that you said? Or you don't want to say something in front of someone. I have this issue a lot because there's a lot of confidential information that I have around the company. I don't want to share it with everyone, but I want to get certain people's opinion on stuff. And if I'm doing a meeting and it's purely physical and everyone is there, I found that sometimes I have to wait until the meeting is over to go get the answer to the question that I wanted. Whereas if I'm kind of having a virtual meeting over Zoom or in VR and workrooms, you can just kind of text people while you're doing that. So I actually think that it will unlock a massive amount of efficiency in communication and expression between people to make it so that people don't have to wait until they're done doing one thing to send a message to someone else. But yeah, I do think that there's a separate question  about if you have glasses and you're kind of going about, you know, it's one thing to have VR and you put it on when you want to go, you know, play a game or do a meeting. In the kind of fullness of augmented reality, when you kind of have the glasses and you're going about that through your life, having some kind of really smart do not disturb mode that has a sense of like, okay, this thing really shouldn't distract you and you're doing something important is going to be, that's going to be a really important AI problem too, I think, to be able to kind of simulate and understand  Because I don't think it's going to be as black and white as do not disturb on or off. I think you want some intelligence there about routing and understanding which things you're going to want to get and which things not. And maybe have certain people have priority, like if your wife or your family is trying to get a hold of you, they can get through, but business people can't get through. Yeah. I worry about additional distractions. I mean, I do not keep my children from social media, because I feel like the world that they live in has social media in it, and I don't want them to be just completely disconnected from that. I limit the amount of time they use their phones, and I try to talk to them about the importance of not being  Like, completely absorbed in social media and these kind of things that these kids do. But I think it's a part of life. And I think it's new and it's weird and it's confusing and it can be very addictive. But I also think it's a part of life. But going out to dinner with them is so hard. They just want to check their, like, hey, put your phone down. Stop snapping with your friends. They're always Snapchatting. I'm like, stop. Stop doing that. It's like, well, we got to stop that. Yeah. It's like, you just got to put it aside. Just put it aside. But if you have glasses on, that's going to be very difficult. It's going to be very difficult to get people to, especially if glasses have social media applications and also offer some sort of a benefit, like a net benefit to the way you view life. Like maybe give you information on the amount of calories if you pick up a food item. What is that? Look at all the calories. Oh my God, it's got that oil in it? That's not good for you. Or other benefits but also has social media. you're gonna come into this like sort of a weird place where you have to figure out whether or not this is a positive thing in your life or whether or not it's overcoming and you're overwhelmed by it. Yeah and I think that that's something that  It's going to end up being this balance, and hopefully our computers and platforms will help us find the reasonable balance on that. I mean, one of the things that you keep, that you've said a few times is, okay, like, I'm not sure if I'd want to do this digitally. I think about, like, it's like, I want to have this experience in the real world. I mean, here's one kind of philosophical way that I think about this is, I actually think when you say the real world,  I call that the physical world. And I think there's the physical world and the digital world. And I think the combination of those increasingly is the real world, right? It's, you know, it's like, there's all this additional information that we bring to the physical experiences that we have, that  whether it's digital or just from our own experience or studying that we've done, that's more than just kind of the physical kind of sensation that we get. But the ratio of that may be shifting over time, right? So in a world in the future where, you know, a lot of the things that might be physical today, I mean, maybe this kind of art and sculptures and stuff that you have here, maybe in the future they're not physical, maybe they're just holograms because, you know, you can change them really easily. Maybe over time the sort of ratio of the amount of physical stuff that we interact with to digital stuff shifts and becomes more balanced or something like that. Whereas, you know, historically it was all physical and there was very little kind of information or digital overlay on top of it. And now I think it just steadily been increasing. But I mean, it's I think it's probably gonna be a lot healthier for us, rather than consuming kind of all this additional context, through this tiny little portal that we carry around on a phone, and you're just kind of like looking at this, and you're missing the whole context, I think to have it be able to be overlaid and, you know, have have kind of people be able to, you know, pop in and interact with them through it. I think that's going to be powerful. We'll obviously need to get the balance on this right. But that's sort of how I think about it. I think probably the right way to think about the real world is, at this point, is not actually just the physical world. But the physical world, I'm probably more optimistic or believe that the physical world is probably more important to our being and essence and soul than a lot of other people in the industry. So I really care about getting that balance right. I think the balance is important, but I think you're correct. I think there is an ever-increasing landscape of digital world that's undeniable, and it's a part of life now. And as the technology improves, it's going to be a bigger and bigger part of life. I wouldn't say my fear is, but my thoughts are that we're going to lead to a time someday where people become fully immersed 24-7 in a non-physical world. I think that's the matrix and that's what people are worried about it that as this technology advances especially with some sort of neural interface That we're going to get to a place where we're not really here anymore or there always Like that how many people are on? How do you do you limit your social media use? How do you do it? I? Me, personally, I mean, I'm just doing so many things that in practice there aren't as many hours in the day. And my kids, I haven't had to think about it quite as much yet, because they're pretty young. Six and five, right? Bloggie just turned five this weekend. So I mean, they use, I actually, I want them to use technology for different things. I mean, I teach them how to code. I think it's like an outlet for creativity. I mean, Auggie especially, Max likes building things. Auggie thinks about it as art. So every night I try to do bedtime with them religiously. So I try to end my meetings in order to be able to put them down. And I ask them what activity they want to do. Do you want to read, or do you want to wrestle, or whatever. And Auggie's just like, oh, I want to do code art. It's like, that's such an interesting way to think about it. I always think of coding as like you're building something, and she just thinks about it as making the computer make art. So it's just like, it's, so, anyway, I think it's, I think it's good for them to get that exposure. But, I don't know, these things, it's not, everything that you're doing on a computer or screen isn't the same. There's a lot of research into well-being. that shows that there's like, are you actively engaging? And are you engaging with a person? Are you building relationships? Or are you just consuming? And if you're building a relationship, then that is associated typically with a lot of long-term benefits and well-being, right? Because I mean, the relationships that we have in our lives, I view that as like the meaning, right? That to me is like the point. And that I think over time is what generally creates happiness for people and prosperity. But if you're just sitting there and consuming stuff, I mean, it's not necessarily bad, but it generally isn't associated with all the positive benefits that you get from being actively engaged or building relationships. Right. And you could engage with people actively online and build digital relationships. And especially as this technology improves, you could actually have meaningful experiences with someone's avatar. Yeah, so I mean, it's very weird. So I just want to make it so that that the experiences that we're having aren't just these like passive things. So from my perspective, there's this like  You know, people spend a lot of time with screens today. It's basically computers, phones, and TVs. And I'm always amazed, because I spend all my time on phones and computers, that for Americans still, almost half the time that they spend on screens is TVs, more than phones or computers. Really? Yes. I mean, I think it might have just tipped to being, in the last few years, to being more phones and computers than TV. But TV is huge. Because I know Netflix and YouTube, I think a giant amount of their stuff is on phones. Yeah, it's a lot on phones, but it's a lot on TVs too, and a lot of people are still just watching cable or different things like that. When you think about new experiences, I actually think the first thing that they're going to go do is eat TV, right? And kind of the more passive things. So when people talk about being worried about the time that people are spending in different kind of social experiences,  I mean, the time has to come from somewhere. I think it's worth looking at where it's coming from. If it's coming from sleep, that's probably not great. If it's coming from exercise, I wouldn't be that happy with that. If it's coming from TV, I'm pretty fine with that. I mean, that's actually maybe a net improvement in well-being for people overall if you're shifting from this more beta kind of consuming state to just being actually actively engaged, potentially building relationships. And there's just a ton of TV time to eat, right? So I think before we worry about this kind of consuming more and more of people's time, I actually just think looking at the mix of what people do today is good. And I mean, my goal for these next set of platforms, they are going to be more immersive, and hopefully they'll be more useful. But I don't necessarily want the people to spend more time with computers. I just want the time that people spend with screens to be better. Because I mean, today, so much of it is like, you're just sitting around and  I don't know, in this like beta state consuming stuff. And I think that that's like, I don't know, that's, I mean, so you asked me, how do I control my own social media time or my time on this stuff? It's like, I mean, I do a bunch of social media. I do a lot of messaging. I really don't watch that much TV. And that's because I just don't have that much, I don't know, I find it, it puts me in this really weird mental state to, unless there's something that I'm just like,  really attached to. So I really like watching UFC, for example, but that's because I also like doing the sport. So it's like I have some kind of connection to it. But I don't know, just sitting around watching. I don't usually get into a lot of TV shows or  Have you always been a very physical person because I follow you on Instagram. Yeah, I see wakeboarding and stuff You're you're very active like which I think is very it's a great message, too It's right. It's great for you But it's also a great message for the people that here's this guy's incredibly busy and his life is overwhelmed with technology yet he's constantly doing physical things and using his body and exercising and getting out in nature and Yeah, I mean, I think it's something that my parents really stressed for me early on. My parents push me pretty hard. They're like, you're going to do well in school, and you're going to be on three varsity sports teams. And a lot of other stuff. You don't have any debate. That's it. This is the rule. That's just what you're going to do. And I'm super grateful for it. They weren't very prescriptive. They didn't tell me I had to do computers, they didn't tell me which sports I had to do, but they were like, this is important. But I don't know, I mean, I've found it, especially as the company has scaled and in some ways become more stressful, it's like more important, right? My sort of day is like, you wake up in the morning, look at my phone, you get like a million messages, right, of stuff that come in. It's usually not good. People reserve the good stuff to tell me in person. But it's like, OK, what's going on in the world that I need to pay attention to that day? So it's almost like every day you wake up and you're like punched in the stomach and then it's like, okay, well fuck, now I need to like go reset myself and be able to kind of be productive and not be stressed about this. So how do I do that? So I basically, I go, I like, I read, I take in all the information and then I go do something physical for an hour or two and just kind of reset myself. And over time, what I've found is that it's not actually just, I used to run a lot,  But the problem with running is you can think a lot while you're running. So I've, especially over the last couple of years, I've gotten really into things that require full focus. So, you know, at the beginning of COVID, I mentioned that I spent a bunch of time in Kauai. Our family has a ranch down there. And like, I spent a lot of time foiling and surfing. And it's like, if you're foiling or surfing and you're on like a wave,  You have to pay attention the whole time, or else you're going to fall and maybe get held under. That's not a great experience. I don't know if you surf. No, I don't. But I tried foiling, and I'm an oaf. I couldn't get on the thing. My young daughter is really good at it, my 12-year-old, and she just zooms around and gets on that thing, and I couldn't figure it out. You're talking about the e-foil for that. I bet if you tried it for a few days, you'd get it down pretty well. That's the problem. I tried it for about three hours, and I was like, oh my god, this is awful. But the actual foiling, not the e-foil. I mean, the e-foil weighs like 40 pounds. An actual foil board maybe weighs like 5 to 10 pounds. So after you learn how to foil, flying an e-foil is like, it feels like you're flying a tank through the air or something. But it's a pretty interesting learning curve. But it requires full engagement the whole time. Yeah. And then, I mean, that's sort of- So it's cleansing. Yeah, yeah. And this is sort of how I got into MMA too, is after, you know, now I don't spend as much time in Kauai because things are ramping back up and I'm in the office a lot more. So it's like, all right, there's not as much foiling in Palo Alto. So it's like, all right, what's a thing that is both like,  just super engaging physically, but also intellectually and where you can't afford to focus on something else. And I think to some degree, it's like MMA is like the perfect thing, because it's like, if you don't, like you, you stop paying attention for one second, you're gonna end up on the bottom. Yeah. So, so it's, so I've just found that that is,  just really important for me in terms of, like, what I do and being able to just kind of maintain my energy level, maintain my focus. Because then, like, after, you know, an hour or two of working out or, you know, rolling or wrestling with friends or, you know, training with different folks, it's like, now I'm ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day. And, like, I've fully processed all the different news for the day that's come in. And we're just ready to go. How did you get introduced to martial arts training? Like, how long ago was this? It was in the last 12 months, actually. Really? Yeah, because it was basically I kind of I used to just run a lot and just do that. And then it was and then basically, since COVID, it's like got super into surfing and foiling then got really into MMA. So how did you how did you initially approach it? Like, how did you get a trainer? Like, what did you do? I know a bunch of people who are into it. There's actually this really interesting connection between people who surf and do jujitsu. Oh yeah, a lot of similarities. So a bunch of the guys who I do that with, they kind of have gyms in Kauai. I basically collected a bunch of recommendations, ran them by a bunch of people who I know, and I ended up... I mean, I trained with this guy, Dave Camarillo. I know Dave. Yeah, in guerrilla jujitsu. Yeah. And he's awesome. He's great. Yeah, super nice guy, and I feel like I'm learning a ton. And the crazy thing is, like, I've... I don't know. I mean, it's, it really is the best sport. I don't, the question isn't how did I get into it? It's how did I not know about it until just now from, from, from like, from the, from the very first session that I did. Like five minutes in, I was like, where has this been my whole life? It's like, all right, my mom made me do three varsity sports, and my life took a wrong turn when I chose to do fencing competitively instead of wrestling in high school or something. It's like there's something that's just so primal. about it that's, I don't, I don't know. It's, it's, and I've, since then I've just introduced a bunch of my friends to it and that's been really fun because now it's like we train together and we just like wrestle together and just, I don't know, there's like a certain intensity to it that I, that I like. And it's, it's sort of, I don't know, maybe it's like there's this cultural thing where, where maybe a lot of people haven't considered it. Right. I've had a 100% hit rate of introducing friends to it and converting them to people who now train. Every single person who I've kind of shown it to is like, this is amazing. This is obviously how I should be training and working out. Yeah. That's very impressive that it's 100%. You must have some solid friends, because a lot of people get turned off by the amount of effort that's involved, but they get excited by the problem solving, which is the more fascinating part, like learning the techniques and focusing on memorizing the techniques and developing the skills. Then drilling like that's probably one of the most important things about jiu-jitsu that people don't do enough of is drilling Like I made my my biggest leaps in martial arts from like blue belt to purple belt just through constant drilling I was drilling all the time with my friend Eddie Bravo. So we were always Working on techniques and so I was able to like progress much quicker and then I noticed when I stopped doing that later my progress kind of stagnated and It's like there's a real clear correlation between the amount of energy you put into drilling and observing the technique and then just going through the motion with someone offering 20%, 30% resistance. It's just not as fun. Sparring is the most fun. You immediately want to just slap hands and start rolling. It's fun. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I really trust Dave, so I think it's also... Yeah, Dave's great. Yeah. And I'm also just depending on what's going on in my life and work that day. Some days I have the energy to go spar, and some days it's good to just go drill. And it's like, all right, there's a lot going on. It's better to just go do something like 20 times in a row. Both things are important. But if you can force yourself to drill more than you spar, you'll get better. It's really important. It's like the most important thing. And it's the thing that people do the least of. Because to really carve those pathways in your mind,  Like when someone is in this position, you do that and then you immediately get your knee in position, you shift your hips. It's just, it gets driven into your programming so that in the flow of an actual rolling session, it just happens. You see Tom Hardy just won a bunch of fucking matches. I did. I did. Tom Hardy is like an ass kicker. Him and Mario Lopez are out there competing in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. I'm like, this is wild. And they're both like beginners. They're both like blue belts. I'm like, that's incredible. Well, maybe I'll get there for my 40th birthday in a couple years. You should do it. Bourdain did it. He did it when he was like, god, I think he was like 60. I just think it's a torment. I do a lot of stuff like this with friends. I also just find like wrestling around with friends is fun. Yeah. It's awesome. Yeah. Wrestling is fun. Jiu jitsu is even more fun because it's like wrestling with like finishes. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited that you're into it. It's really cool. And I think, you know, it really enhances your enjoyment of watching it on television because you know what's happening. But there's also, like, a lot of good parallels, I think, in philosophy for life and work and all that. I mean, I think, I mean, both surfing and foiling and jujitsu, MMA, it's like,  I think it sort of teaches you about like the flow and momentum of things. And I think businesses like this in a similar way where it's like the hardest thing is knowing when you're in a position where you need to push through versus sort of developing the intuition for when like, all right, when  like the momentum is just going in the other direction. It's like, all right, you're not going to be able to pump over this well. You know, it's just, it's, you know, if you keep your weight in this direction, you're going to get swept, right? I do think, I mean, it's a super concrete thing. I think one of the things that's sort of frustrating running a company is like the feedback loops are so long, right? It's like, all right, so I showed you the, you know, the pre-release version of the new  VR headset that we're building, it's like, we've been working on that for years. And now it's like, so basically the ideas that went into that, and there's obviously a lot of problem solving even up until now to kind of get it to work well, but the basic principles of, okay, what big features are we going to prioritize? I mean, made those decisions years ago. And we're not going to know if that's right until maybe a year from now, until we see how that goes. So there's something that I think is sort of, it's difficult in running an enterprise of that scale to like, try to learn from things that's such a long It's such a long interval, and it's something that I just find super rewarding, is having these parts of what I get to do on a day-to-day basis, where you're learning about, you get to push on the world, or push on other people, and get to see how that goes a second later, instead of four years later. It's like, all right, am I going to be able to, like, go turn that direction on that wave, or am I just going to get swallowed? Right? So it's, I don't know. It's, I think that having that mix in your life is, it feels really important and healthy to me. And I mean, I try to get my friends into it. I mean, my kids do, do jujitsu, too. I just think it's, like, really important that they kind of develop all these, all these skills and appreciation for doing physical things, just like my parents taught me. But I don't know. It's, I guess overall, it's like a big part of,  I don't know, it's a big part of what I, of who I am, I think. I mean, going back to the other conversation about like, are we just brains and tanks? It's like, no, because this is like the part of my life that I think is, it's like, this is super fun. Like the building things, it's like, that's super engaging too. It's just, it's like a very different type of intellectual exercise. What's also the one-on-one physical connection with a person? I would imagine that your life has got to be very bizarre because you are the head of this enormous platform and you're dealing with so many human beings and so much negativity and positivity and all kinds of fires that you have to put out and all sorts of chaos and to just have a  one thing, one person right in front of you is probably really good to sort of clean the pipes out and just clear your mind and have your ability to focus on things sort of put into perspective. It's gotta be very unmanageable. I've talked to people about this before. Whenever people talk about social media sites and they're doing this and they're doing that, I'm like, could you imagine trying to manage at scale five billion people? Or whatever it is. How many people are on Facebook right now? Facebook is almost 3 billion, but across our different properties, it's a little more than 3.5 billion. That's so many people. That's impossible. No one can manage 5 billion people, or 3 billion people, or a billion. The numbers are just so absurd. It's so preposterous. It doesn't make any sense. So like I would imagine that for your mind the amount of pressure that's involved in just maintaining it's like it has to be like looming over you at all times in the background. Like it's probably very difficult for you to find things that filter that out. Yeah. I mean. There's always stuff to work on, right? So I think a big part of trying to push forward is maintaining enough control of my time to push on the things that I believe need to be advanced for the future rather than being reactive. Like, if my day is primarily consumed with just reacting to things that people are throwing at me, I mean, I can spend all of my time a thousand times over just reacting to all the things that people throw at me and I still wouldn't get through the whole list. Which, by the way, I mean, I think that that's probably a somewhat extreme version because I'm running this company, but I actually think this is probably true for everyone. I think pretty much every person, I think, has a lot that gets thrown at them. And you could spend all of your time just reacting to that. And I think a lot of what kind of creates the ability to be successful long term and to build things and change your life and build products that change other people's lives is  carving out the time to do stuff that's proactive. And that's both taking care of yourself and being physical and getting out there and also getting to spend time with my family and my girls and all that. But it's also, I mean, I could spend all of my time just working on the things that we've already built and not trying to advance this vision for the future. But balancing that is important. I mean, it's like I also spend a ton of time on all the social media pieces of what we're building. I mean, it's like they're nowhere near done, right? And there are some awesome evolutions that are happening there with enabling more creators and enabling more people to have a voice there. I mean, the creative economy has sort of exploded over the last,  few years and I think it's just at the beginning of like sort of hopefully remaking a lot of the economy for the country and the world so that way more people can pursue creative endeavors. I think that's just going to be one of the most positive trends that comes out of this decade. I agree with you 100% on that. It's really an amazing time for people to be able to carve out an alternative living and to do so through social media platforms. And there's so many people using all the platforms that have developed these followings and started businesses, and whether it's in fitness or there's people that are just chefs that they cook online and they share and sell recipes. It's amazing. Yeah, I mean, and one of the things that  that I really admire about what you do is, you know, it seems like you have a real commitment to giving a voice to a lot of different types of people, right? It feels like a big part of your theme is, you know, you have a lot of people on the show who would just nowhere, like, no chance that they'd get the exposure that they get from talking to you elsewhere. And, you know, part of the question that I wonder about is in Instagram and in Facebook,  You have your follow graph, you have the people you choose to follow, and you have your friends. But can we build AI systems that can also just help recommend better content that you didn't know to follow yet? Because it's up your alley, it's aligned with the type of things that you care about, your values, your interests. And I just view that kind of confluence of building. It's a very specific AI problem. It's not like this kind of general intelligence AI problem. I tend to think about things in terms of more specific problems that you can break down and try to deliver value for people. But I think I'd just love it if in a couple of years, a significant  not the majority, but a significant part of the Instagram and Facebook experiences were basically highlighting different creators who you might be interested in but might have not otherwise seen. And I think that that would both be good for people who are using those experiences to discover more people, get more diversity of input into their lives, but also, I think, can help push that creative economy forward. I don't know. That's one of the things that I'm super passionate about right now. Well, having an algorithm like that could really help. One of the things that Spotify does really well is suggest new music. I love how they do that, where if you like a certain kind of music and you develop these playlists, they'll start recommending you music. And I found out about so many different bands that I would never know about before. I think it's really, the thing that gets people with algorithms is that algorithms today have this negative connotation to them. There's a lot of argument that algorithms cause dissent and cause arguments and cause strife and that people are focusing only on the things that upset them. The real problem with that is that they're not taught how to think and focus on things. Because what the algorithms pick up on is essentially, what are you spending the most time on? Well, if you're spending the most time on carpentry and parasailing and deep sea fishing, that's what the algorithm's going to recommend to you. Like my friend Ari, we went through this experiment where we only Googled puppies. and the only YouTube puppies. And that's all they recommended him. Like, YouTube videos was all just puppies. And he's like, see, like, all this stuff that people are saying, like, oh, the algorithms are tearing us apart. Like, no, we're tearing us apart. The algorithms just highlight the things that you're interested in. It's not like the algorithms are some tricky program designed by the communist government to try to get you to argue with each other. No, you're arguing. You like to argue. Yeah, I mean, I think that  The algorithms can also obviously be designed better or worse. So, you know, one of the things that I'm pushing on a lot right now is there's this idea in designing recommendation systems of  explore versus exploit, in that it's like, okay, if someone has spent a bunch of time, you know, searching for puppies, you know, they like puppies. So if you show them a puppy video, they'll probably engage with that. But if you only show them puppy videos, over the long term, you're missing an opportunity to understand what other things that they're interested in. So even though it might not be kind of ideal for the experience today,  Carving off 5%, 10% of basically the experience to just try to expose people to different things, to see if they're interested in that too, ends up paying long-term dividends. So I do think that these systems done well, if you design them with a long-term perspective and you're not just trying to kind of maximize engagement today, but you're really trying to understand what people care about and who people want to become and what their values are,  I think you can build some stuff that gets really good over time, but I do think that the design of the system and the values that go into it matters quite a bit too. I think so, too. I'm not neither pro nor con algorithms or recommendations. I think it's a fascinating aspect of social media, but I do think that there are certain people that, unfortunately, when they get excited about a thing or when they start going online, they gravitate towards things that irritate them and upset them. And that's the big concern that many people have with algorithms and with the use of social media, Twitter in particular, is that people are using it and getting upset and it's creating more tension and more of a divide. Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting to think about these services, not just in terms of the information that is conveyed, but as a product designer. a big part of what you're designing is the emotional experience that people have using it. So, like, I just don't want to build something that makes people super angry, right? And I think that these things have different charges to them, right? I mean, Twitter, I agree. It's like you're on it, and it's the plus side of it is that you get all these people who are super witty and are saying super insightful things, but a lot of them are very cutting. And I find that it's hard to spend a lot of time on Twitter without getting too upset. On the flip side, I think Instagram is a super positive space. I think some of the critique that we get there is that it's very curated and potentially in some ways overly positive. But I think the energy on Instagram is generally very positive, and it's easy to spend time there and kind of just like absorb a lot of the positivity. I think that's true, but how did that happen? Why is Instagram generally friendlier? I mean, so I think it's the design of the system, but one thing is I think images are  a little less cutting usually and kind of critical than text. I think the news in general is often negative. I think the incentives of the news industry are often to Well, I think just the mission of the news industry is to speak truth to power and highlight things, hold people accountable. So I think that even if you're looking at it from that perspective, I think a lot of the stuff generally has this very critical tone to it. But like with everything, there's just a balance. If you spend your whole life living in criticism, then that's super negative. But I think that, you know, what we've tried to do with Facebook is have a little bit of both, right? I mean, Facebook has images and videos, but it also has news. And the part of it that's probably the most critical where we probably have the most controversies around the more newsy type stuff, the more political type stuff. And over time, I mean, I've generally just felt like  hey, that's not even what people in our community tell us that they want. People say that they come here because they want to connect with other people and explore interests. So I just want to emphasize that more of it. But there are some very intentional decisions that you can make in terms of designing this stuff. So for example, on Facebook, when you're reacting to a post, in addition to liking it, you can heart it, you can give it kind of an angry emotion. One of the decisions that we've basically made is if someone kind of gives an angry reaction, we actually don't even count that in terms of whether to show that to someone else, or maybe we even discount it. So you could kind of view it as, okay,  someone chose that they were interested in this post and chose to give an angry reaction, but we just don't want to amplify anger. That's not what I view us as here to do. So we're just going to basically take that signal and not use it to show the post to more people. So how do you do that? How do you decide, what if it's anger, but it's justifiable anger? Yeah, I think that's exactly the right question. is basically, you know, when I was making that decision internally, a bunch of teams were like, well, you know, there is a lot of stuff that's wrong in the world and people should be angry about that. And it's like, yeah, I think that's probably, that's fair. But I'm not here to design a service that makes people angry. So I kind of think that there's a balance. And it's not like there's not going to be any angry stuff. I mean, people can still react and say that something is negative if they don't like it. But I don't view our job as going and needing to kind of amplify all that stuff. So why do you have the option to have an anger response? Well, I think it's good for people to be able to convey it. So is it like a thumbs down? Yeah, it's like an angry emoji face. And so obviously there's the option to have angry comments, which is just people's ability to express themselves. Yeah, yeah. But we basically choose to  If someone likes something or if a friend chooses to share something, we use that as a signal to say, hey, this might be something that you're interested in because someone reacted to this, right? It's like a friend had some kind of emotional reaction to this and thought it was interesting enough to engage with, so you might also think it's interesting to engage with. But we try to intentionally mute the kind of angry reactions just because that's just not what we're trying to do in the world. I appreciate that. What do you think about the argument that algorithms in general, because the fact that they sort of appeal to human nature, like they amplify the things that you're interested in, and unfortunately people are interested oftentimes in things that upset them. What do you think about the argument that this is too  whether it's too influential or it has too much impact on people and that a better solution would be to just let everything exist how it exists and don't have any kind of algorithm and let people find what they find and share what they share and just let it exist in sort of the free market of ideas. Yeah, so we actually started there, right? Because at the beginning, we didn't have the technology to do this kind of ranking. And the very first thing that you run into is if you don't do any kind of ranking, the system gets gamed in different ways. So if you're not ranking anything, the most recent stuff  shows up  you miss obviously really important stuff. All right. So like my cousin is pregnant and when she has a baby, she's going to post about that. And like that post better be at the top of my feed because I don't want to miss that. Right. It's like, I want that update. And like, and we know that that's valuable even without knowing the, um, even if we don't understand the, the kind of specific content of what, what, what she posted, there's going to be a ton of people commenting congrats and,  And a ton of hearts and positive reactions. So that's the question there. How does that enter into the algorithm? If you're going to favor something like your cousin's baby being born, how would you go about doing that? And how does the AI figure out that your cousin just had a baby and that this should be in all the people that follow her, it should be in all their feeds? Because they would want to know, yay, she had the baby. Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of it is just there's a lot of signals that go into it. But at a simple level, you can kind of just look at, um,  Who are the people who you care about? And what do they find interesting? So what are they commenting on? What are they clicking on? What are they liking or hearting? Those are some of the big signals, right? And then there's some kind of content-based stuff, like we have a sense that you're interested in this type of thing or that you really hate politics or whatever, so we're gonna show you a little bit less of that. But in general, the thing that will differentiate that cousin's  baby was just born post is that even if our system has no idea what the post means,  That post will almost certainly just have a ton of likes and comments on it that have a positive reaction. So that will just tell us, OK, if your friends made 500 posts today, that's the one that has the most positivity around it. We should probably show that more prominently. So I think at a basic level, a system that didn't do that stuff  would clearly be an inferior system. You don't want businesses spamming, and you don't want to miss obviously important stuff. Is there a way to stop businesses from spamming that you could just limit the amount of times they could post in a day? I mean, there are a bunch of things like this that we've tried over time. I mean, but then you start getting into some things that are basically pretty algorithmic or rules-based, which is like,  You know, you start trying to rank stuff based on the kind of quality of the posts, right? Or sort of how much engagement they make. I mean, I guess you could tell people they can't share more than this amount. But I don't know. It kind of feels to me like you want to create a system. And there are certain creators.  who do pump out a large amount of content. And I'm not sure that you want to stop that. I think you just want a system that can basically titrate it and show people the amount of it that they're interested in. It's such an immense responsibility and the fact that it's a private company in some ways troubles some people because you have this ability to control the flow of information and that's really never existed before where there's been like obviously social media is very new that's never existed before and then having a company that's run by human beings that have the ability to decide what gets  Broadcast what gets its signal amplified what gets suppressed all that stuff is very It's it concerns a lot of people because it's basically just individual human beings with their own biases and their own perspectives and their own view of the world and they have the ability to either slow down or ramp up or suppress or  amplify so many different ideas and in turn that can literally shape the way the cultural narrative goes on any given subject. What is it like having that kind of responsibility? Because it seems to me that that would be an immense burden. That would be like a lot of thought would be involved in like, what are the negative consequences of the choices that we make? What are the positive consequences of the choices we make? Because, you know, as you said, you're controlling the signal of three plus billion people. That is so astounding to even say. Well, I think the important thing is that I don't exactly look at it the way that you said. I view our job as empowering people to be able to express what they want and get the content that they want. And whenever we try to exert some kind of opinion that's different from what people want, our products do worse. And we exist in a very competitive space. I mean, we have TikTok that's growing incredibly quickly. There's a whole lot of other companies, we talked about Twitter before, you talked about Snap, YouTube is huge and people spend a ton of time on it and there's just like new social products all the time. So if we don't empower people and help people get and advance their own goals, then we lose over time. So I just, I kind of think that that  You know, obviously serving a lot of people is a big responsibility, and we take that super seriously. But we also appreciate and respect that this is like a very competitive marketplace. And our role in it is not to kind of imprint our opinion, but to empower people. And that's sort of the ethos where we started the company is, I mean, the initial, you know, mission statement is, you know, give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. And we've evolved that over time to now making it around building community and bringing people and bringing the world closer together. But it's fundamentally, that notion of giving people the power and empowering people is like really deep in the ethos of the company. And I think whenever we mess that up, which we do frequently, we pay the price for it. And people don't like those things that we do. And then we have to run them back. That goes back to managing at scale, right? Because you're just dealing with so many different people. But what I'm saying, essentially, is I do agree that you are giving people the ability and the power to express themselves. And if you don't do it correctly, they're going to go to the competitors. But it's still an immense responsibility, if there are choices being made as to what gets amplified, what gets suppressed, what gets  removed from the platform. And I'm sure there has to be some pretty intense conversations about how this is managed and handled. And the burden of that must be tremendous. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of different parts of what you just said. I mean, I think in terms of kind of helping people discover the things that they want, I think that's a pretty different wing of what we do than the policy setting of what is not allowed, which I think is in a lot of ways  I think, a more controversial piece because in the what's not allowed, you have to get into the nuances of specific types of content, whereas in terms of the recommendation systems,  You kind of want to build those to be agnostic of the type of content. If I see that a team is trying to promote some type of content over another, they're almost certainly doing something wrong that is going to make us worse than a competitor in terms of effectiveness of our product. Because you should just build this technology in a way that is agnostic and lets people express the interests and things that they want and gives them that. And then every once in a while I think that there are some editorial decisions that  often they're important enough that I have to make them, like that thing that we talked about before, which is like, I just don't want there to be as much anger, so we're going to not take into account the angry reaction. It's probably the case that there would be more engagement on the platform if we didn't. It's like people are expressing something and we're choosing to not listen to that thing. So at some level, it probably makes the product somewhat less engaging, but that's an example of an editorial decision that it's like, At some level, you know, we're here not just to focus on what content people see, but the kind of emotional sense. But I try to make those very few, just because the technology can enable a vast breadth of interests that different people have. And I think part of how you build something that can serve billions of people  is by not telling people what to think. And basically having humility and basically, I don't know, just valuing humanity and valuing that people can believe different things and that those beliefs are probably grounded in real lived experiences that they had and aren't the result of them being tricked or something like that. It's like they believe what they believe for a reason. And it's kind of good to generally let people express that. I don't know, that's a pretty deeply held belief that I have. One of the things that's got to be bizarre about having a platform like Facebook is that you know that there are foreign actors that are utilizing the platform to either spread propaganda or to start arguments. We read once that I think it was 19 of the top 20 Christian sites on Facebook were run by a troll farm. I didn't see that one. Let's see if we can find it. It's pretty crazy. The amount of resources that are put into creating fake pages, or pages that don't really represent real people, but promote certain ideologies, or certain political agendas, and that they'll use these and start arguments with people. And you don't even realize, the people think they're arguing with real people, and they're reading the opinions of real people. Meanwhile, there's a guy with a bank of phones in Macedonia. Yeah, no, so we call this- Here it is. 19 of 20 Christian Facebook pages are fake. Yeah, so we call what you're talking about coordinated inauthentic behavior. Coordinated inauthentic behavior. So it's basically coordinated, right? Some of these policy acronyms that we come up with, they have to be very specific. Yeah, I get it. But basically, we have a team of hundreds of counterterrorism and counterintelligence people. Who basically try to look for these different signals to find and like you said a lot of this is I mean that one That that you were just mentioning. I don't know who is who is behind those fake pages But in the Macedonian troll farms were basically a bunch of spammers who created fake pages and they want people to click on them so they can make money from the ads. So that one's actually pretty easy to disrupt because you just make it so that they can't use the ads to monetize anymore and their whole economic incentive goes away and they sort of dry up. Dealing with nation states is a lot harder because they're more kind of ideological or sovereignty motivated. So there, I think you just kind of need to be very vigilant, and it's more of an arms race, and you just kind of are building up better technology for defense, and you assume that they're going to keep on getting more sophisticated, and you keep on needing to get better. But I mean, at this point, we have like, I don't know, it's like tens of thousands of people working on this at the company. I think we spend like  $5 billion a year was the last stat on sort of all this community integrity work. I mean, it's like our kind of defense budget, it's like, I mean, just to put the numbers in perspective. I love how you call it a defense budget. I mean, basically, it's like, I mean, it's to defend the integrity of the community. But it's like, I mean, it is, I think, bigger than the defense budgets of probably most countries. And this is obviously a super critical part of what we need to do. But then, you know, there's also this important set of philosophical discussions, which is like, all right, something almost everyone will agree that like, that's bad, right? Like, you don't want, you know, countries basically creating networks of bots trying to convince people of stuff. You don't want terrorism, or you don't want child pornography. Like, you don't want people inciting literal violence. But then the question is, OK, so you build these capabilities to try to find this stuff. And it's a combination of basically humans, really expert humans, and really powerful AI systems working together. But sometimes they get it wrong. And then we end up taking down accounts that we weren't supposed to take down. And that sucks, right? Because then we're kind of getting in the way of people expressing legitimate things. There's, you know, no system is ever going to be perfect. So the question is, you know, do you want more on a false positives or false negatives? Do you want do you want there to be more kind of fake Christian pages or do you want to accidentally take down? I don't know. What was the example recently of like the comedian who had a profile photo that had a kind of a gun in it and the that we accidentally took down the  this guy's page that we were talking about this before. Oh, Kill Tony? Yeah. Yeah, the Kill Tony podcast. Yeah, so it's like, all right, so some like AI system was just like, all right, like, that's clearly violence, right? It's like the profile picture like literally has a kind of rifle sight and a gun that shows the guy dying. So it's like, so I mean, that sucks. Like, I mean, this is some of the stuff that I mean, this like hurts me, right? Because like, when we when we take down something that  that we're not supposed to. I mean, that that is like, I mean, that's the worst. I mean, that's like discern, like how, like, say, like these Christian Facebook pages. I don't know how they found out that 19 of 20 were fake. But if someone just says, I am Bob Smith, and they post as Bob Smith, and they have a photograph, and they, but really what they're doing is trying to talk shit about Joe Biden and get people to vote Republican in the midterms. Like how? But how do you know whether someone's real or not? This is the big argument with Elon and Twitter. Because Elon asked Twitter, what percentage of your website is filled with bots? And they say 5%. And he says, I don't believe you. I think it's higher. And let's find out how you've come to this conclusion. And I believe they said that they just took 100 random Twitter pages and looked at the interaction and there's some sort of an algorithm they applied to it. But how do you discern? Yeah, so I mean, I think estimating the overall prevalence is one thing, but I think that the question of looking at a page and is this page authentic, I think that there's a bunch of signals around that. One of the things that we try to do is for large pages, we try to make sure that we know who the admin of that page is. We don't necessarily, you should be able to run an anonymous page. You don't necessarily need to out yourself and say who you are running it, but we want to make sure that we sort of have  like an identity for that person on file, so that way we know, at least behind the scenes, that that person is real. For certain political things, I think having a sense of what country they're originating from, I mean, some of that you can do just by looking at where their server traffic comes from, like is the IP address coming from Romania? Because if it's an ad in some other country's election, then you probably want to make sure that that ad is, especially in countries that have laws around that, are coming from someone who's a valid citizen or at least in that place. So there's a bunch of, I think,  I don't know, one theme in my worldview around this stuff, when it gets to some of the stuff that we talked about before, is like, I don't think that this stuff is black and white or that you're ever gonna have like a perfect AI system. I think it's all trade-offs all the way down, right? And you could either, you could build a system and you can either be overly aggressive and capture a higher percent of the bad guys, but then also by accident take out some number of good guys, or you could be a little more lenient  and say, OK, no, the cost of taking out any number of good guys is too high. So we're going to tolerate having just a little bit more bad guys on the system. These are values questions right around, what do you value more? And those are super tricky questions. And part of what I've struggled with around this is I didn't get into this  to basically judge those things. I got into this to design technology that helps people connect. You could probably tell when we spent the first hour talking about the metaverse and the future of basically building this whole technology roadmap to basically give people this realistic sense of presence. That's what I'm here to do, right? So this whole thing that's like arbitrating what is okay and what is not, I obviously have to be involved in that because this is at some level, I run the company and I can't just abdicate that. But I also don't think that as a matter of governance, you want all of that decision-making vested in one individual. So I think one of the things that our country and our government gets right is the separation of powers. You know, one of the things that I tried to create is we created this oversight board. It's an independent board that basically we appointed people whose kind of paramount value is free expression, but they also balance that with things like when is there going to be real harm to others in terms of safety or privacy or other human rights issues. And basically, that board  people in our community can appeal cases to when they think that we got it wrong, and that board actually gets to make the final binding decision, not us. So in a way, I actually think that that is a more legitimate form of governance than having just a team internally that makes these decisions or, you know, maybe some of them go up to me, although I don't spend a ton of my time on this on a day-to-day basis. But like,  I think it's generally good to have some kind of separation of powers where you're architecting the governance so that way you have different stakeholders and different people who can make these decisions. And it's not just like one private company that's making decisions even about what just happens on our platform. How do you guys handle things when they're a big news item that's controversial? Like there was a lot of attention on Twitter during the election because of the Hunter Biden laptop story, the New York Post. Yeah, so you guys censored that as well? So we took a different path than Twitter. I mean, basically, the background here is the FBI, I think, basically came to us, some folks on our team. It was like, hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump of  that's similar to that. So just be vigilant. So our protocol is different from Twitter's. What Twitter did is they said you can't share this at all. We didn't do that. What we do is we have  If something is reported to us as potentially misinformation, important misinformation, we also have this third-party fact-checking program because we don't want to be deciding what's true and false. And for the, I think it was five or seven days when it was basically being determined whether it was false. The distribution on Facebook was decreased, but people were still allowed to share it. So you could still share it. You could still consume it. So when you say the distribution has decreased, how does that work? Basically, the ranking in News Feed was a little bit less. So fewer people saw it than would have otherwise. So it definitely- By what percentage? I don't know off the top of my head, but it's meaningful. But basically, a lot of people are still able to share it. We got a lot of complaints that that was the case. You know, obviously, this is a hyper political issue. So depending on what side of the political spectrum, you either think we didn't censor it enough or censored it way too much. But but we weren't sort of as black and white about it as Twitter. We just kind of thought, hey, look, if the FBI, which I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it's a very professional law enforcement. They come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something that I want to take that seriously. Did they specifically say you need to be on guard about that story? I know. I don't remember if it was that specifically, but it was it basically fit the pattern when something like that turns out to be real. Is there regret for not having it evenly distributed and for throttling the distribution of that story? What do you mean evenly distributed? I mean, evenly in that it's not suppressed. It's not- Yeah, yeah. I mean, it sucks. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because it turned out after the fact, I mean, the fact checkers looked into it, no one was able to say it was false, right? So basically, it had this period where it was getting less distribution. So yeah, I mean, I but I think like, I think it probably it sucks, though, I think in the same way that probably having to go through like a criminal trial, but being proven innocent in the end sucks. Like, it still sucks to have like, that you had to go through a criminal trial, but at the end, you're free. So it's, I don't know if the answer would have been, don't do anything or don't have any process. I think the process was pretty reasonable. You know, it's we still let people share it. But, but obviously you don't want situations like that. But certainly much more reasonable than Twitter stance, and it's probably also the case of armchair quarterbacking, right? Or at least Monday morning quarterbacking, I should say. Because in the moment, you had reason to believe, based on the FBI talking to you, that it wasn't real, and that there was going to be some propaganda. So what do you do? And then if you just let it get out there, and what if it changes the election and it turns out to be bullshit? That's a real problem. And I would imagine that those kind of decisions are the most difficult. The decisions of, like, what is allowed and what is not allowed. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what would you do in that situation? I don't know what I would do. I would have to, like, really thoroughly... Well, first of all...  You're dealing with the New York Post, which is one of the oldest newspapers in the country. So I would want to talk to someone from the New York Post, and I would say, how did you come up with this data? Where are you getting the information from? How do you know whether or not this is correct? And then you have to make a decision, because they might have got duped. It's hard, because everybody wants to look at it after the fact. Now that we know that the laptop was real, and it was a legitimate story, and there is potential corruption involved with him, we think, oh, that should not have been restricted, that should not have been banned from sharing on Twitter. Right. I think everybody agrees with that. Even Twitter agrees with that. But the thing is, then they didn't think that. In the beginning, they thought it was fake. So what do they do? If something comes along and the Republicans cook up some scheme to make it look like Joe Biden's a terrible person, and they only do it so that they can win the election, but it's really just propaganda. What are you supposed to do with that? You're supposed to not allow that to be distributed. So if they think that's the case, it makes sense to me that they would try to stop it. But I just don't think that they looked at it hard enough. When the New York Post is talking about it. You know, they're pretty smart about what they release and what they don't release if they're do if they're going over some Data from a laptop and you could talk to a person But again, like this is just one story like one individual story like how many of these pop up every day? especially regards to polarizing issues and  like climate change or COVID or foreign policy or Ukraine, anytime there's a really controversial issue where some people think that it's imperative that you take a very specific stance and you can't have the other stance. Those moments on social media, those trouble a lot of people because they don't know why certain things get censored or certain things get promoted. Yeah, I agree And it's like to be in your spot And I was one of the things that I really wanted to talk to you about is this because like to be in your spot must be insanely difficult to have no matter what decision you make you're gonna have a giant chunk of people that are upset at you and There might be a right way to handle it, but I don't fuck right way is well. I think the right way is To establish principles for governance  that try to be balanced and not have the decision-making too centralized. Because I think that it's hard for people to accept that some team at Meta or that I personally am making all these decisions. And I think people should be skeptical about so much concentration around that. So that's why a lot of the innovation that I've tried to push for in governance is around things like establishing this oversight board. So that way, you have people who are luminaries around expression from all over the world, but also in the US. I mean, folks like Michael McConnell, who's a Stanford professor. I forget which Republican president appointed him, but I mean, he was, I think, going to be considered for the Supreme Court at some point. very prominent and kind of celebrated free expression advocate, and he helped me set the thing up. And I think like setting up forms of governance around  that are independent of us, that basically get the final say on a bunch of these decisions. And that's, that's a step in the right direction. I mean, in the the Hunter Biden case that you talked about before, you know, I don't want our company to decide what's misinformation and what's not. So when we work with with third parties, and basically, let different different organizations do that,  Now, I mean, then you have the question of, are those organizations biased or not? And that's a very difficult question. But at least we're not the ones who are basically sitting here deciding. We're not the Ministry of Truth for the world that's deciding whether everything is true or not. So I'd say this is not a solved problem. Controversies aren't going away. I think that there's, it is interesting that the US,  is actually more polarized than most other countries. So I think sitting in the US, it's easy to extrapolate and say, hey, it probably feels this way around the whole world. And from the social science research that I've seen, that's not actually the case. There's a bunch of countries where social media is just as prominent, but polarization is either flat or has declined slightly. So there's something kind of different happening in the US. But for better or worse, I mean, it does seem like the next several years do seem like they're set up to be quite polarized. So I tend to agree with you. There are going to be a bunch of different decisions like this that come up. Because of the scale of what we do, almost every major world event has some angle that's like the Facebook or Instagram or WhatsApp angle about how the services are used in it. So yeah, I think just establishing as much as possible independent governance so that way  I'll obviously have to be involved, our teams. Nick Clegg, who I appointed to be the president for all the policy issues for the company, and he was formerly the deputy prime minister in the UK, a successful politician there and very well-versed in government and all those political issues. We'll have to do some part of this, but I think also getting to more and more independent governance is going to be an important part of how we deal with this. Why do you think the United States is more polarized? What do you think is happening over here that's causing that? I'll speculate, but I think that there are people who have studied and thought about this a lot more. I think there's probably a media environment. issue that predates the internet, right? So I think we have sort of it seems like I don't want to say uniquely because it's probably we're probably not the only country that has this. But in terms of having like some of the news  is so far left, and some of it is so far right. I think, you know, there's all this talk about filter bubbles on the internet. But I mean, I think even predating this, like going back to like the 70s or 80s, when Fox News and all these other, you know, cable, these these kind of prominent media organizations were established. I think that that has had a long-term effect, and people have studied that. But there might also be something about just the way that our governance is set up, where we have two parties. We have these primaries that basically make it so that it's almost like you're not promoting people who are trying to be the centrist. You're basically promoting people who are the extreme of their party. really sensible reforms like open primaries, right, that I think would probably have a pretty big impact on the political culture in the country. And some of these other countries that are a little bit more parliamentary, by definition, just allow there to be more candidates on more parts of the spectrum. But I want to be careful about not talking too far out of school, because I'm not a political scientist. But I've obviously spent a little bit of time thinking about this, because  You know, I think a lot of people want to point to social media as the primary cause of this. And I just think when you look at the fact that polarization has been rising in the US since before the Internet, that just makes it seem like it's very unlikely that social media is kind of the prime mover here. And then if you look at  The fact that there are all these other countries around the world where social media is used just as much yet the polarization is flat, or just not growing that quickly, or in some places even going down, kind of suggests that that really is not the primary thing that's going on. I don't know. I mean, it's a really tough set of questions. I think you're dead on with the open primary idea, because this idea that it's only party loyalists who get to vote on each side, you're promoting this ideological adherence instead of reasonable ideas that people can enjoy or not enjoy and resonate with or not. I don't think social media is to blame, but I think social media for a lot of people, it accentuates the divide because it gives them more time to immerse themselves with it. And I think it's an unfortunate aspect of some people that they spend a lot of time distracted on things that don't immediately affect them. But those things become their main focus in life. And I think that's a distraction. That's almost like a form of procrastination that people get involved with. And it just seems like a natural thing with people. And I think it's a time management issue, and I think it's a discipline issue. And I think some people have never really been taught time management or discipline, especially in regards to the type of information that you take in. They just like see something that upsets them. What is that? What's going on? Why are they doing that? And then they just get upset and then that's their whole day. And, you know, I see things as in terms of like, I'm very, very careful with time management. Because anything that's going to take up too much time, that's not net benefit, that I'm not enjoying, or is going to wind up being a negative thing, I'm not interested. But I've developed this over time to recognize that's a trap, get out of there. You can't put out all the fires. Yeah, you will be a fireman all day long There's no way if you just want to be upset at things and just engage with things that will upset you There is no shortage of news stories. There's no shortage of political issues There's no shortage of everything and you have to figure out time management and discipline and some people never do and I think that's more of the problem than social media and Algorithms and all these different things that people are blaming for our woes more of the problem is a lack of  education, explaining to people that if you're awake for one hour, during that hour, it is your choice what to think and focus on. In 24 hours, it's the same thing, you're just spreading it out. You decide what to do. Now, if you want to spend all of your time going back and forth on Roe v. Wade on Twitter,  Good luck. Go do that. You're not going to change the landscape. That's what voting is for. You're not going to change people's opinions. If you want to make interesting videos and post them on Facebook, okay. If you want to talk about things and have a perspective that you think is really well formed and it's compelling,  Go ahead, make that. But if you get sucked into that world of just looking for things to complain about, that's really you. You don't have to do that. No one's forcing you to do that. Yeah, I mean, I think your point around what do people have control over is really important, because I think the people who are  happy and productive, I think, tend to focus on things that they have some agency over. And it's not that the other issues aren't important, right? And national civic issues, I mean, they matter. But there probably is a healthy balance. I mean, this just goes back to the time management conversation we were having before, which I mean, you could spend all your day and more, a thousand times over, just reacting to things that are going on in the world. But I do think there's really a thing around kind of narrowing the aperture in your life to what's around you, the people you care about. I think that that does drive a lot of happiness for people. And so I think it's one of the interesting questions is how do we balance now having access to just historically unprecedented amount of information about issues that are going on in other places, which on the one hand drives  In theory, it should drive more transparency and accountability and energy towards those things. But, I mean, maybe that just needs to, like, that needs to, like, that energy needs to come over a, you know, balanced over a longer period of time or something. Like, I tend to think that all the transparency that we've gotten from social media will lead to good progress on a lot of things. But I do think it can, if you just focus on  kind of broader issues and not, if you don't, if you don't focus, I do know there's a certain thing about people's happiness that has to come from, you know, what's right around you in your world. Most definitely. And that's not to say that you shouldn't get upset about important issues. And express yourselves. It's just a matter of how much time you're spending on it. Unless you're really disciplined and really careful with your time, you can get sucked into these things and you could waste your life just arguing with people online. And I don't think it's healthy for folks. For entertainers and comedians in particular, it's really bad. I see so many comedians that get so much anxiety from reading comments and going back and forth with people who are talking shit to them on Twitter. And I always tell them, don't do that. It's really bad for you. I struggle with this too. Do you? Well, on the one hand, some of this is free product feedback. Right. I actually think this is one of the hard things about it. you don't want to be so close that you're not listening to criticism because then you're not going to grow. But I think finding people and outlets that will provide criticism but from a place of actually trying to help you grow rather than tear you down is very rare. So I don't know, I struggle with this. I do sometimes feel like I need to  I do want to try to understand all of the different perspectives that people have. But I think the thing that's tough is that a lot of those people aren't necessarily trying to help us build something better. And there is just a lot of negativity in it. It gets to you. And I think that there's a question of balance where at what point are you kind of better off? It's like, yeah, you want to push forward on the things you believe in, but you don't want to, you know, put on blinders and not consider alternative viewpoints. But then you could spend all your time looking at critique that's not necessarily trying to be constructive. And then that's just going to be super negative for your mental health. So yeah, I mean, I think probably a lot of the happiest and most productive people are at least like they're, I don't think you're ever going to carve out  I don't think you should want to close off all that stuff completely, but I think at least being able to carve out a good amount of your day to be able to focus on what you want to push forward and things in your life that matter is, I think that's just really important to being a grounded person. I think it's also important to establish an ethic where you communicate with people online the same way you communicate with them if they're in a room with you. And I think that is not something that a lot of people adhere to. People, they talk to people on Twitter like it's not a real human without, they don't have real feelings, and you're just trying to say the most biting, mean, and cutting thing that you can. And that's unfortunate. I don't I don't do that I used to engage in it like I'd used to argue with people back and forth and I realized Like what am I doing? Like this is not good. I always feel like shit. I never feel good Even if I win the arguments, it doesn't feel good It's all you're filled with anxiety and then a new fire starts up in the comments, you know Like someone else will jump in and then you got a new opponent and like what are you doing? like well, that's that's a  massive resource problem. Like, it's a giant issue in whether or not you want to focus on important things in life, or whether you want to, like, win these little verbal battles between people on Twitter or Facebook. It's just not necessary. It's just for allocation of resources. It's a terrible idea. Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, what we hear from our community is that that's not what people want to spend their time. Something that there is, I think that part of the challenge in designing products is  Sometimes what people tell you that they want to spend their time on is different from what they actually do spend their time on. But I think a lot of the time, even if people's revealed preferences of what they actually spend their time on are different, it's  there's some truth and aspiration to what they think they want to spend their time on, that there is some long-term value in helping out with that too. So that's why I've just consciously tried to just downplay a lot of the political controversy on the services a bit. It's like, what do people come to our services for? It's connecting with other people, right? And expressing what matters to you, which, I mean, for most people isn't some kind of big global issue. It's like something that matters in their life. Like, what's going on with my kid's life? How's my wife doing? What's going on in my local community, right? I don't know, I think that there's something that's powerful about being able to focus more on that and be a bit more grounded in that. It's not that we do that perfectly, but I do think social media tends to  allow that a lot more than previous mass media did, because by definition, mass media just had to focus on issues that concerned a lot of people at once, whereas I think one of the best parts of social media is that it is so inherently local to just what matters to you and your friend group. I mean, what's more kind of local to you than the specific people that you have relationships with? I mean, that's the appeal. That's why so many people use it. Very good point. And also, the interesting aspect of social media that I think often gets ignored is the discussion of social issues. I mean, people have a greater understanding about how most people think about social issues today than we ever did in the past. We were sort of informed how we felt about things based on the news, based on the rare commentator on the news, or stories that were in the news, or editorials that were in the New York Times, or what have you. And now you get a day-to-day sense of how people feel about things. And of course, it's also clouded by people that are saying things to sort of virtue signal and get people to like them based on the opinion they think is going to be the most likely to attract positive attention. But it at least is opening up this new field of people openly debating and discussing ideas that used to be only talked about by people that were already approved and on television and in the media. So we sort of get this  But particularly about videos, right? Videos are a really interesting example of that, because someone can have a really concise and interesting perspective on something, and that'll get shared millions and millions of times. And it just has to go viral. It just has to catch someone's opinion and go, wow, she's got a really good point. And then that gets out there. That is really powerful. And that's something that never existed before, where just a regular person with an interesting idea can just catch fire. Yeah, and I think that that's an area hopefully with better recommendation systems that will be able to be more possible in the future than has been in the past, I think, as the AI can kind of help people discover things that they might be interested in. But yeah, I mean, I'm a little more mixed on this. I mean, I think on the one hand, I think the comments and actual discussions that happen online.  are not as good as they could be. I mean, I think live interactions, like what we're having now, I think that that's hopefully an interesting discussion for people who are watching. But I think if you look at common threads, like you're talking about, I think that that experience probably needs a significant amount of innovation before it's good. But I do think being able to see different people's opinions and  maybe more like the original posts than the comments back and forth. Because when I see a friend has some opinion on something, I know where that person's coming from, right, in terms of their values and their life story. And that just means a lot more to me than, I don't know, the New York Times telling me that something is good or bad. And there's also a lot of diversity because people, you know, tend to have friends who are from different backgrounds. And, you know, before the internet, I think the average person basically, you know, they had a few different media sources. They probably had, you know, each one had some kind of specific editorial leaning. You know, now, the data that I've seen on this actually is that social media generally exposes people to a way more diverse set of views. Now, there is a question about how people react to that. I think sometimes when people see stuff that they don't agree with, there's a  productive way to present something that someone might disagree with in an unproductive way. And sometimes if you present something that someone's not going to agree with, they'll actually kind of shell up and disagree with it even more after being exposed to that point of view. So that's another area that we and the rest of the industry might be able to improve on over time. But I think that this notion around  filter bubbles and like people only see one type of thing. You know, I think it by this point has been pretty thoroughly debunked in terms of just like statistically, the diversity of what you're seeing on online from different sources is way greater than it than it ever was before. I think people just don't make very compelling arguments. That's one of the reasons why so few people are willing to think and listen to differing opinions on things. You know, it's so often people are either preaching to the choir or shouting down at the person that has the opposing view instead of expressing themselves in a very neutral and objective way that considers all the possibilities. And this brings me back to fact checks, like fact checkers, because oftentimes fact checkers are incorrect, and they are biased, and it is subjective as to whether or not what is a fact and what is not a fact, especially about some more controversial issues. How do you choose fact checkers, and how does a fact checker ... How do they go through a mountain of data and come to a conclusion? And then that is used for content moderation. Yeah, so there's a whole discipline around and like professional discipline around fact checking, where, I mean, these organizations are supposed to basically, they get accredited. And they're generally, I think, quite professional about how they do this. Generally. Yeah. And so, I mean, that's another thing is, you know, not only did we not want to, you  be deciding what is true or false. We also didn't want to be in the business of deciding which fact checkers are professional or not. So we basically outsourced that to this accreditation. It's widely respected as sort of the best that there is, even though it's not without flaws, like you're saying. But what we tried to do  was basically we give the fact-checkers the basic guidelines to not focus on things that could be opinion-y, right? So there are things online that are like obviously  I don't know, just like obviously kind of wrong memes or, I don't know, like crazy conspiracy theories or something like that. And I think that that's a pretty categorically different set of things than like, is there some shade of to which some political candidates said something that was slightly false? And like, can we use that as an excuse to like, ding them? Right. When the program is working the way it's supposed to, I mean, the overwhelming majority of people in our community tell us that they don't want to see things that are kind of obviously false flowing through the system, right? It just decreases trust in the system. And if there was a way to get rid of that, then it's like people on both sides of the political spectrum would want that to be the case. I think where it ends up being an issue is when the fact checkers sort of veer towards getting into stuff that's  not as obviously black and white and a little more political. I mean, not not a lot. I mean, a lot of the stuff that's blatantly wrong isn't necessarily even political. It's just like stupid shit. And it's so I think that those are the areas that that that I've seen that become the most controversial. How do you make decisions when, like, I can understand the wanting to stop the spread of misinformation, but there's certain things that are so dumb where I feel like they should be allowed to be spread, like flat earth. Like if someone has a flat earth theory, God, I want to listen. I want to listen because it's so dumb. I want to know how does someone start to form these ideas? Because there's a thriving community. I don't know if you know, have you ever Googled hashtag space is fake? I have not. You should. There's a large group of humans out there that believe that we live in some sort of a dome and that there's essentially light bulbs hung in the sky. It's so dumb. But I mean, what do you do about that? If I was running Facebook,  I would let that stay. I would leave that in there. That's so dumb. So one important nuance on this, though, is we don't block misinformation. We basically just have a label that goes on it that says that a fact checker says this is false.  and show it a little bit less in the ranking and newsfeed. But don't you stop a person's ability to share something that has that tag? You can share it. But what if someone is a person that is known to spread certain misinformation? Don't you make it so you can't tag that person? It depends on what the stuff is. I mean, we can go super deep on all the nuances. There's misinformation that could lead to harm, right? So misinformation that veers on things that lead to violence or health safety that we treat in one way. And then there's just misinformation, like stuff that's wrong that people say reduces trust in the system when they see it, but that  we have no reason to believe is going to lead to any like physical safety issue for people. And that we just treat differently. I mean, that it's like, yeah, we'll put a label on it. We'll, you know, if we have the choice to either show your cousins, you know, giving birth photo or that we'll, we'll kind of show the other content above it. But fundamentally, we're not going to prevent you from sharing it or, um, or, or, or prevent people from seeing it. You know, when Jack Dorsey and I had a conversation about this, one of the things he said that he was in favor of and was trying to promote the idea of two versions of Twitter. He wanted to have a moderated Twitter and then he wanted to have a Wild West Twitter. Like he wanted to have something where it's like 4chan or something, just like let people do whatever they want and just open up those barn doors and as soon as you go in there it's chaos. Like, what do you think about that? And do you think that there is an important function of content moderation that the set of tone? I mean, you can kind of see it. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think that the tough thing is there's like,  Most of the categories of harmful content are things that I think almost everyone would agree on. So it's like, you don't want foreign nations interfering, like the bot networks. You don't want terrorism. You don't want child pornography. You don't want blatant intellectual property violations. You don't want people promoting violence. So you go through all this stuff. Most of that stuff, I actually think, is not that controversial. It's like people want it gone, and they expect us to, as a technology company that operates at scale, to be able to do this reasonably well. So then I think that there are a couple of issues. One is sometimes those systems get that stuff wrong, and we say that something is bad when it wasn't, or we miss something that is bad. So I think that there's that type of issue, which is like you just make an operational mistake, which is important, but is kind of one type of issue. Then I think you get into the types. There are a couple of types of issues, and I think misinformation is probably the biggest one.  where there is actually just not widespread agreement at all about how to handle it. I think that a large percent of the population, the vast majority says that they don't want to see misinformation, but then people disagree on what misinformation is, right? So people don't want to see what they think is misinformation. But honestly, even more than that, they don't want other people to see what they think is misinformation. So that's pretty difficult, because then different people have different views. And I think that there, I mean, maybe you could have a policy like what Jack was talking about for that type of content. I mean, I don't think you're going to have a Wild West version of social media where you're just allowing terrorism free for all. I mean, that's crazy, right? The Taliban is on Twitter. Which is really wild, because Donald Trump isn't. I'm not super deep on Twitter's policies, so it's tough for me to comment on that. Twitter has pornography. I mean, they have hardcore pornography. You could just accidentally stumble onto someone you follow's page, and they'll have hardcore pornography. That's something that just is more of, going back to your point around just for the community feel. pornography is a thing that we don't allow and I think it's somewhat controversial because I mean it's like you could make a pretty good argument I think that like this isn't doing physical harm to people I mean I know that there's arguments on both sides of that so I don't I don't want to go super deep on that but like but  I'd say our reason for not wanting pornography is more for the feel of the community than kind of the sense of harm. And obviously child pornography is different. That's obviously real harm. But I think that's one category of content where it's kind of more of an editorial moderation decision. I don't think it's a political decision. It's just it's more of like we want the feel of the service to be about people connecting with their friends and family and not necessarily coming across that kind of content. But yeah, I mean, that's sort of, I think, how the whole thing breaks down. I mean, there's most of the stuff that I think gets taken down, actually, most people would agree needs to get taken down. And then I think there's mistakes. And then there's, you know, stuff like how do you handle misinformation, which I think society as a whole doesn't agree on. So my basic approach to that is  give people choice. And try it like so basically don't take it down. But basically let people share the stuff but also flag if something if an accredited fact checker said it might be false and also get us that we shouldn't be the ones deciding what's true and false. So kind of try to set up this independent governance to do that. I think it's pretty well balanced system. It's not perfect. We'll need to keep on iterating on it and making it better over time. But those are the basic principles for kind of how I how I think about navigating that. One thing that people freak out about, and oftentimes I'm a little skeptical of their concerns, is people think they're being shadow banned. It's always people think they're being shadow banned. Like, is shadow banning a real thing? And what does that mean? Well, I mean, there's no policy that is shadow banning. So I think it's sort of a slang term. But that maybe refers to some of the demotions that we're talking about. Right. So if someone posts something that gets marked as false by by a fact checker, then it'll get somewhat less  Just that post or all of their posts for the future? I think that there's, if you do it once, then it's that. And then I think if there's like some history within a page or there's kind of different rules for pages and groups and different things, then there can be some kind of broader policy that applies. When I look into this stuff, because a lot of my friends and people I know just send me examples, because unfortunately there are a lot of mistakes. I mean, I think part of the issue is that, OK, if there's three and a half billion people using these services, and if we make a mistake 0.1% of the time, that's like,  still millions of mistakes, right? So there's all these cases, and that sucks, right? So there are all these cases where we miss something that we should have taken down, or we enforce something that we weren't supposed to. But I'd say  As it relates to kind of concerns about shadow banning, a lot of the time when I look into stuff, people attribute some motive, or like, ah, this is like meta has some stupid policy in place that blocked this, or they're banning this thing. And a lot of the time, it was either just a mistake. So nothing was supposed to happen, but there was some bug in the system, or some system didn't work the way it was supposed to, which is a real issue, but it's not an ideological issue. A lot of the time also, when people are worried about stuff like shadow banning, maybe their post just wasn't as good or something, and it just didn't get the distribution that they wanted it to. But I don't know. You highlighted some examples to me a few weeks ago of someone who was saying that they couldn't follow your account or something, and you posted it. So I looked into it, because I'm like, OK, I'm going to see Joe soon. I want to understand what these issues are. And that's an example where it's like, it had nothing to do with your account. It was basically, there was some bug, and that person had taken a bunch of actions quickly or something. And we basically just, for spam protection, stopped them from taking a bunch of actions. So I think people sometimes read in some ideological bent or policy thing into this that I think often isn't there. But unfortunately, there just are  Because the scale is so big, there are going to be millions of mistakes. You're going to be able to find almost any pattern that you want in that much data. So I haven't figured out how to crack that nut of kind of communicating. It's also an interesting problem because there's people don't really know what's going on behind the scenes. So there's this like sort of in their eyes a lack of transparency. It's like how how does this all work. So they assume there's nefarious intentions and that someone is. Yeah. Someone's censoring them. Yeah. I mean how do you have any. I mean I'm curious how you'd think about this if you were in my position. I've thought about it. I would imagine it would be incredibly overwhelming, and I'd probably be on Xanax. I don't know. Or you'd just work out more. I'd work out more. I wouldn't take Xanax. You'd just do more MMA. But the amount of foreign countries that you're dealing with, too. I mean, you have Facebook in how many languages? Oh, I don't even know. I mean, we just ruled out an AI tool that allows  us to translate posts to all these languages where they're, it's like just, yeah, it's like hundreds of, I think it's more than a hundred languages. I don't want to get the number wrong. Well, I love to use that on Instagram, like especially because I follow a lot of Jiu Jitsu guys and they'll say something in Portuguese and I can click the translation. Yeah, yeah. That's there. That should be there. No, it is there. It's really cool. I love that. It's really nice, but the amount of countries that are using this, I wouldn't even want to just pay attention to the people that are speaking English. You're trying to moderate all the people that are speaking a million different languages. How? Oh, yeah. I can't imagine. This is one of the things I wanted to talk to you about is when you first started Facebook,  You clearly could have never imagined that it would become what it is now. What was it like going through the stages of growth of this thing? Where, oh great, it's successful. Oh hey, Facebook is taking off. Holy shit, we're overthrowing governments. What is happening? What is this thing now? Yeah, what what has that been like for you to assume? this position and to have this position evolve and spread and for you yourself to become this a  Worldwide figurehead and you know become this insanely successful person who is involved in this Social media platform that is so massive it's just so beyond and now with what's happened you have Instagram and you have You have oculus you have all this going on. I mean, yeah Am I freaking you out just thinking about it? No, no, no. No, I've spent a long time. Yeah, yeah. It's like, breathe deeply. No, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. I don't imagine. Just like, it's like, why us? Like, what happened that we were the ones who built this? Like me and this group of people. Where's my space? Where'd it go? Yeah, you know? Here's my reflection on this. And I mean, I'm curious for your view on if you think this is just crazy. But like, when I was getting started, I remember  The night that I launched the original Facebook website at my college, right, it was just a website for my college to basically you can it was it was literally a Facebook, right? It's like my Harvard didn't have a paper Facebook. And I was like, this is stupid. Let's just make a version where people can input their own stuff, because people like expressing stuff about themselves. And people are really interested in learning about other people. So let's go do that. And we can help people connect around that. So I launched it, I went to go get pizza with my friends. And that night we were talking about how it was really cool that I got this out at Harvard and people were going to use it at Harvard, but someday someone was going to do this for the world. it was not even like a possibility for me that that was going to be us. It was like completely obvious that it was going to be someone else. Right. It was like, like, we're just college kids. Like, who are we to do this? Right. It's, um, you have like Google and Microsoft and Yahoo at the time, these like great technology companies that have thousands of engineers and like all these servers and all this resources. So it's like, it just wasn't, it wasn't even a question. It wasn't even a hope that I had that we would do it, but then like, okay. So we just kind of kept going, right? So I launched it at Harvard, and then... What year was that?  2004. And a bunch of students from other schools started writing in, and as soon as I optimized the code and basically got, like, could make it so that I could run this at more colleges at the same time, I started launching it at more colleges and, like, launched it at, like,  two more colleges at a time, like every week. And it just kind of kept on going. I think a lot of people just kind of wrote it off. It was this thing that a lot of people in colleges loved, but people were like, OK, that's kind of a kid thing. It's not going to be a global thing. And I was like, no, someday someone's going to do this. It's going to be a global thing. But Google and Microsoft and all these companies could never really get motivated to do it, because there was probably a bunch of internal bureaucracy or forces that were naysaying against why this was a valuable thing. So then, okay, then the people who were in college started graduating and they kept on using it. So then it was like, okay, so this clearly isn't just a college thing. And we started in 2007, we opened it up beyond college so that anyone can sign up and people of all different ages started signing up. And then the meme shifted from this is a college thing to this is a fad, right? Because people, you know, you mentioned MySpace and, you know, there's this whole string of social apps like this. There's Friendster and there's MySpace and it was, the whole thing was there's like one after another. So it's like, no, there's not going to be one for like 20 years, right? That lasts for like for 20 years or 30 years. It's like, this is a fad and probably  Inside Google or Microsoft, there were probably people who thought that this would be a cool thing to do and go build this, but probably a bunch of bureaucracy and people naysaying on it. So we just kept on going. And then the next meme was, oh, it's never going to be a good business. OK, so there's 100 million people using it. They've been going for five or six years. You know, it's, maybe it's not a fad, maybe people are going to keep on using it, but like, but I mean, there's only one good internet ads business and it's Google. So it's like the chance that like someone can invent another one. It's like, that seems really low. So it's like, I don't know, just, no one really motivated. So I guess my reflection on this is that I think with so many things in the world,  I think we did it because we just cared more and actually believed in it. So we just kept going, right? It shouldn't have been us. Like people had more resources all along the way and cared more. And I've just found that that's actually sort of something that I've noticed in other areas too. So if you notice like, if you think about like what, what like Elon's doing with rockets, you know, or like what we're trying to do with the metaverse, right? It's just like, these are sort of these crazy things. And I do think at some level,  just the people who believe in them the most and are willing to spend like a decade or 15 years of their life kind of digging in the trenches when investors are telling you that it's not a good idea. Or, I don't know, I think like, kind of care. is probably undervalued in terms of determining what who ends up doing what in the world. I think most people probably have an assumption of like something that is so obviously true to you that you just assume that other people are going to go do it. But just because it's so obvious to you doesn't actually mean that it's that obvious to other people. Right. So I mean, you probably have this around a lot of the stuff that you do, like the stuff that you talk about, the way you you kind of explore all these different topics on your podcast, the way you do comedy. But  I don't know. I mean, I'm curious if you've had that experience where it's like you just where you feel like those things are just like so obvious that obviously other people should get them too, but then just like no one does. I think you had the advantage in the early days of being young and having a perspective that's not overly influenced by commerce and by corporations and by corporate politics. If you think about it, Google tried to do it with Google+. I remember I had a good friend that worked at Google. But it was too late then. Yeah, it was too late. I was joking around with her. I'm like, this is dog shit. This is never going anywhere. It's terrible. And they didn't have an original idea. You can come late to something as long as you have a unique contribution that you can bring to the space. But they didn't, yeah. So you were trying to get people to escape, leave from other social media platforms to go to this other clunky one that is just basically like a beta version of some new Facebook. Yeah. It wasn't compelling. You can't build the same thing six years later. You have to add, yeah. Yeah, it wasn't compelling. It is interesting though, because it's like when a product like yours achieves escape velocity, it gets to this point where it's just so big and it's like you have to have Instagram, you have to have Facebook, everybody uses it. It's just one of those things. And I am always fascinated to, like, what is that like for the person who made it? And it's got to be so bizarre to see it just continue to spread. I mean, it's not getting smaller. It just keeps getting bigger, which is nuts. Like, you're over three billion people and it's getting bigger. That's nuts. Well, how long do you see yourself doing this? How long do you see yourself running it? Do you think there's ever going to come a point in time where the stress is just overwhelming and you're like, just pawn it off to somebody else? I'm not sure if that'll be the reason. I think I'm probably going to do this for a while just because I kind of viewed the phases of the company as  The first phase was building Facebook. And I was like, OK, can we build a social product that's super successful? And we did. We basically made the most used service in the world. And then it's like, OK, once you're lucky, but can we do this multiple times? And then that's when we got Instagram joined us super early. I think there were 16 employees at the time. And I think it had 20 million people using it or something super early. When did you pick up Instagram? What year was that? It was the same year we went public. But it was really small at the time, super talented team, Kevin, super talented guy who created it, Kevin and Mike, and did a lot of awesome work together. And then the WhatsApp folks joined. I mean, I think there were about 60 people working at WhatsApp. These were super early things when they joined us. But we've scaled both of those to, I mean, WhatsApp now is...  you know, more than 2 billion people. Instagram is, I don't think it's quite 2 billion yet, but it's basically, it's on its way. So, and then Messenger, we kind of grew from scratch, and that has more than a billion people too. So it's like, okay, so now for the second phase of the company, it's like, went from building one  One great social experience to now building four. So it's like, all right, that's pretty good. We can we can do this. We can keep on evolving these things. And as you say, they keep on growing and the businesses around them are good. We're just empowering a lot of entrepreneurs around the world. So really happy about all that stuff. And there's a lot more to do. But I look at a lot of what we're doing still just in those experiences feels constrained by the fact that it's happening on a phone. And I just think phones are very limited. So I think for the next chapter of what we're going to do, it's about continuing to build those, but also defining what the next computing platform is going to be, which is for me what the metaverse is all about. immersive world and feeling of presence that you can have with another person. I mean, you're never going to feel a super deep sense of presence with someone on the phone, but that's like the holy grail. If we can deliver that through glasses or a headset, then like, that's what I'm going to dedicate the next, you know, 10 or 15 years of my life to. But like, I don't know, my outlook though, on what types of things I want to focus on, I mean, I'm curious how this has changed as you've grown in your career too, but like for me,  I don't know, for the first maybe like 15 years of building the company, I was really just like solely focused on like, let's connect more people. Let's grow this community to be bigger and bigger. Let's grow the business to be bigger and bigger. And now, I mean, I obviously care about that. I mean, I want to continue seeing these things thrive. But I think about my life more now in terms of projects that I want to take on, on like a decade-long basis. And there's some things that work, right? So like building out the metaverse and with VR and AR and building out the whole developer community and creator community around that. I view that as 10, maybe if it takes longer, 15 year project, but that's like something that I just want to kind of dedicate myself to.  Done a lot of stuff on the philanthropy side where I just like, it's been really cool getting a chance to work with my wife Priscilla on this. It just like opened up a whole new side of our relationship where like, it's like we were,  partners and now we also get to work together and she's brilliant and she is a doctor and just understands so many more things about biological science than I do and I can bring this whole engineering perspective and like we can  We learned so much from doing that together. But basically, you know, our philanthropy, I mean, the long-term goal is to basically create tools for the scientific community to enable them to either be able to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases within this century. And I think that's possible. I mean, it's, but not within the decade, but within a century. So, you know, for that, you know, we're taking on a bunch of kind of tenure projects  to just sort of be able to observe different things about human biology working that haven't been seen before. So, like, one example is we're working on this imaging institute, an imaging project, where we want to be able to be able to, and you have, like, microscopes today, and they can see stuff, but it's, like, pretty hard to see things that are going on, like, inside your body, right? You know, so you're blocked by the other tissue that's in the way. But now, through a combination of different techniques, you can use this, like, cryo-EM technique, where you can, like, take certain tissue out of a person, and it still will be... I mean, there are techniques where some of the tissue will still be alive for some period of time, even though it's obviously going to die because it's been removed from you, and you can look at that under a really powerful microscope. And then you can use AI techniques over time  to be able to kind of extrapolate from what you've seen in very high resolution in the tissue that you've removed from the body to now being able to, okay, even though there's like optical and physical limits on what you can see with a microscope in a body, you can use all this data that's been generated in AI to effectively be able to see different cells interacting. Like no one has ever seen a synapse, you know, a neuron like fire and like what it looks like in the synapse of a brain before  like, in a living organism. But I kind of think my engineering perspective on this is, like, how are you going to debug a system or help solve it if you can't, like, step through the code, right? Like, one line at a time and, like, see everything that's happening, right? If you want to really understand what's going on in the brain, you need to see that, right? So, I mean, that's the kind of project that we're doing on the philanthropy side. So that's, like,  That's pretty cool too, right? But it's like a different kind of thing. So over time, I've sort of broadened out. It's not just, for the first 10 years or so, the company was so all-consuming that I really couldn't do much else and I wasn't that well-rounded of a person. I think having a family changes that. I think it sort of forces you to become a little more balanced. But now I'd say there's projects at work, there's project in philanthropy. There's also just personal stuff that I just really enjoy, like building up our ranch to be self-sustaining and 100% off the grid and being able to grow all the stuff that we want there and raise our own cattle. And I think that that's a cool, fun project too. So at this point, I sort of define meaning in my life more by getting to work  with people who I really like on a different set of things and just get to learn from doing a bunch of different things. But I'm curious how that's kind of shifted in your life as you've grown in your career too. Well, I think what you're dealing with is you have so much success that you're comfortable enough for you to not think about just success and to only think about growing the business. Instead, you're thinking about projects that are fascinating to you. Which is the ultimate form of success, right? Could you actually focus on the things that you're really interested in? Whether it's in philanthropy or whether it's in like personal projects and hobbies or just business ideas that you might not even think are like the most financially viable. They're just fascinating to you. I think that's amazing. I think that I would love to see that in more people because I think  So many people just get caught up in the game of resources and numbers and they just want to grow numbers and grow and have more money and have bigger toys and a bigger this and bigger that and It's a trap You know, and I think sometimes people are caught in that trap when they're ahead of the game. They're they're winning the game They've won the game, but yet they're still like sucked into it and they never really branch off and find things that are deeply fulfilling to them and  It's really unfortunate because that's the trap of the businessman. The businessman gets consumed by just wealth. They get consumed by success of the company, eternal growth, and it's a real trap. I have a similar perspective in that I don't think about my show in terms of how it grows or how it does well. I just do what I like to do. And I think as much about archery and jujitsu and playing pool and automobiles. I think about a lot of different things. I don't just think about the podcast. And when I do the podcast,  The very fortunate thing that I have is that who I talk to is entirely based on whether or not someone's willing to talk to them or whether or not I'm interested in talking to them. So that's all it is. There's no external pressure. So it never feels like a job. It's always like, oh, Mark Zuckerberg. I'd love to talk to Mark. He seems like an interesting guy. I don't like the way you sip water, though. When you're sipping water in the Senate, you're sipping water like a robot? Let me see you take a real drink. Go ahead. I mean, honestly, the Senate testimony is not exactly an environment that is set up to accentuate the humanity of the subject. Quite the opposite, right? I don't know. I mean, if you're up there for six or seven hours, you're going to make some face that's worth making a meme out of. Right. And then they're just going to only concentrate on that. And that's gonna be the big deal, but you know so I'm just fortunate that I can do this and just and the appeal of the show I think I mean if I had to think about it I don't think about it too much honestly, but if I thought about I think the appeal of the show is that I'm actually interested in in what the guest has to say and it's because those are the people I've chosen and  Whether it's I'm talking to a scientist, or a philosopher, or an athlete, or you, or anybody. I'm interested. I'm genuinely curious, and if I wasn't I wouldn't do it. And so because of that, I think it translates to the people at home, and it resonates with people. I was going to say paradox. I'm not sure if it's a paradox, but I think that there's, there actually is a feedback loop between those things. I would guess though, right. It's like, you're saying that you don't care as much about the viewership or the listenership of the show, but to some degree, because you're following your curiosity, you probably are producing a more interesting show that more people want to watch. I'd bet that for me, if, if I were solely focused on just kind of  just turning the crank on the business, it would probably incrementally grow. But I think the way that people deliver these discontinuous entrepreneurial results is by investing in things that other people don't believe in yet and having conviction around things like that. So, I mean, I'm not focused on the metaverse primarily because I think there's some near-term business opportunity. I actually think we're going to lose a lot of money for a long time on this massive breadth of things that we're working on that we talked about before. I mean, I think that if we do good work on this, I think we should be positioning ourselves quite well for the future. And I do care about winning for all of our employees and our shareholders and stuff like that, too. I mean, that obviously matters, because we have all these awesome people who are actually doing the work. Yeah, it's a brilliant gamble, but it's also a very well-informed gamble. And you're not just gambling, you're innovating. So it's a really cool place to be. But what you're saying and what you're talking about is  Authentic focus and interest and I think today in this world where there's so much bullshit It's so hard to know what's real and what's not real people value in authentic they value authenticity rather they value it in in a really unique way and And when someone can create a service or a social media platform or something where people really believe that the people behind it are trying to make it the best thing possible. And they're not just trying to grow it forever and make it constantly get bigger and make more money. They're also genuinely trying to innovate, and they're genuinely trying to expand into this new realm of the metaverse, and they're genuinely trying to moderate content in a thoughtful way. That resonates with people. It's very important. That's probably one of the reasons why it's so big. And I think that applies to many, many, many things. But I think people are oftentimes very short-sighted, and they're only thinking about growth. They're thinking about constant, never-ending growth, and they're not necessarily thinking about, why am I doing this in the first place? What if I didn't have to do this anymore? What if I had so much money that I could do whatever I wanted? Would I still do this? And why would I do it? And how would I do it differently? How would I do it differently if I wasn't thinking about just money? I was thinking in terms of big picture things and making it more enjoyable, making it more thrilling to me, making it more exciting. And I think that we're very fortunate, you and I, in that we have the ability to take those kind of choices. And I think that kind of freedom is probably one of the most important freedoms for the Western person that's listening to this, that is not confined in a communist country. There's obviously a lot bigger problems that they have. But you're in a position where you can make your own choices. What would be the best choice to make? Well, the best choice to make is to actually follow your interests. What is actually fascinating to you? And for you, the fact that you're really interested in health and philanthropy and those things as well as also interested in the metaverse and interested in AR and VR and all these different modalities, all these different ways to express it and how enriching it is to people's lives.
