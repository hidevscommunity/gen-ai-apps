[{"video_id": "RcYjXbSJBN8", "text": "welcome back here we go again great to see you and congratulations thank you um you will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born you will know for the rest of this child's life you were born during a weird time that's for sure that is for sure they're probably the weirdest that i can remember uh yeah yeah um and he was born on uh may the fourth and yeah that's hilarious too yeah may the fourth be with him yeah exactly it has to be hopefully i sure hope so perfect yes i mean that was the perfect day for you and how do you say the name well uh is it a placeholder first of all my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name congratulations to her yeah yeah she's great at names um so i mean it's just x the letter x um and then the ae is like pronounced ash yeah and then a12 a12 is my contribution oh why a12 uh archangel 12 the precursor to the sr-71 coolest plane ever that's true i i agree with you i don't know i'm not familiar with it i know what the sr-71 is yeah yeah yeah i know what that is so the sr71 came from a cia program uh called archangel oh it's the archangel project and then archangel 12. oh wow what a dope-looking plane yeah oh okay i got it yeah well as a person who's uh very much into uh aerial travel as you are that's uh perfect that's pretty great yeah pretty great um so is it does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going does it feel like you've had children before is this any weirder uh it's actually i think it's better uh being older and having a kid i appreciate it more um yeah babies are awesome they are pretty awesome they're awesome yeah when i didn't have my any of my own i would see other people's kids and i didn't not like them sure but i wasn't drawn to them sure but now when i see little people's kids i'm like oh i think of them like these little love packages yeah little love bugs yeah it's just you you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you like your whole idea what a baby is is very different yeah so now as you you know get older and get to appreciate it as a mature fully formed adult it must be really pretty wonderful yeah wonderful it's great but babies are awesome yeah yeah that's uh that's great um yeah um i mean also i've i've spent a lot of time on ai and neural nets and so you can sort of see the kind of the brain develop which is you know what an ai neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does basically um and you can sort of see the it learning very quickly you know it's just wow see things fire so you're talking about the neural net you're not talking about an actual baby i don't know about actually an actual baby but both of them yes but the word neural net comes from the the brain it's like a net of neurons so you know it's like the yeah humans are the you know original gangster the neural net that's a great way to put it yeah so when you're programming artificial intelligence where you're working with artificial intelligence art are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain in a lot of ways there's some ways that are different um you know an analogy that's often used is like you know we we don't make a submarine swim like a fish but we take the principles of of how you know what of hydrodynamics and apply them to a submarine i've always wondered as a lay person do you try to achieve the same results as a human brain but through different methods or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results i mean the essential elements of an ai neural net are really very very similar to a human brain neural net yeah it's having the multiple layers of neurons and you know back propagation these all these things are what your brain does you know it's sort of yeah um you have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and that and then it'll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place um it's um yeah it's it's interesting very interesting yeah i would imagine like the thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us that one day it's going to be like why did you do it that way like when artificial intelligence becomes sentient they're like oh you tried to mimic yourself like this so much better process cut out all this nonsense but like there are elements that are the same but just almost like like an aircraft does not fly like a bird right yeah it doesn't flap its wings but the wings the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as bird now you're in the middle of this uh this strange time where you're selling your houses you say you don't want any material possessions and i've been seeing all that and i've been really excited to talk to you about this yeah because it's an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself like why are you doing that i'm slightly sad about it actually but if you're sad about it why are you doing it i think i think possessions kind of weigh you down then they're kind of an attack vector you know people say hey billionaire you got all this stuff like well and now i don't have stuff now what are you gonna do attack vector meaning like people target it yeah um interesting yeah but you're obviously gonna so you're gonna rent a place yeah okay and get rid of everything except clothes no i said like almost everything so it's like keep a couple teslas yeah sure yeah kind of have to test product and stuff um yeah those things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those here um yeah so do you feel like what's worse that could happen right you're fine yeah you could always buy more stuff if you don't like it especially yeah i mean from the money that you sell all your stuff you could buy new stuff but do you you feel like people define you by the fact that you're you're wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way for sure i mean not everyone but right you know there's uh for sure in recent like years billionaire has become a per jar like it's in a projective so like it's like that's a bad thing um which i mean i think doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases if you've if you're done if you basically uh organized a company like see like how do how does this wealth arise it's if you organize people in a in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital so it's there's a conflation of consumption and capital allocation so let me say warren buffett for example and to get totally frank i'm not his biggest fan but uh you know he does a lot of capital allocation um and he reads a lot of a lot of sort of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it's pretty boring really um and he's trying to figure out is does coke or pepsi deserve more capital i mean that's i mean it's kind of a boring job if you ask me um but uh you know it's still a thing that's important to figure out like which is a company deserving of more or less capital should that company grow or expand is it making products and services that are better than others or worse and you know should you know if a company is making compelling products and services it should get more capital and if it's not it should get less we'll go out of business well there's a big difference too between someone who's making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who's making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines it's it's a different thing and to put them all in the same category seems it's it's very simple and as you pointed out it's an attack vector yeah for sure yeah i mean i think it's it's really i i do think they're in the in the united states especially there's an over allocation of talent uh in finance and law uh basically too many smart people go into finance and law so you know this is both a compliment and a criticism we should have of i think fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff yeah yeah well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff yeah yeah absolutely um and and you know manufacturing used to be highly valued in the united states and these days it's not it's it's often looked down upon which i think is wrong yeah well i think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with china that it there's a lot of value into making things into making things here yes somebody's got to do the the real work yeah you know and um you know like making a car it's an honest days that's not honest day is living that's for sure you know or making anything really or providing valuable service um like providing you know greater entertainment good information but these are all valuable things to do um you know so yeah there should be more more of it did you have a moment where is this something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realize that yeah i've been thinking about it for a while um you know part of it is like i like have a bunch of houses but i don't spend a lot of time in most of them and that doesn't seem like a good use of assets like somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them than me so don't you have gene wilder's house i do that's amazing that's awesome wow exactly what you'd expect did you request that the buyer not [\u00a0__\u00a0] it up yeah that's a requirement oh a requirement that's that's a good requirement yeah not in that case in that house yeah it'll probably sell for last but still i don't care uh he's a legend yeah he would want his soul he'd want his essence yeah in the building it's and it's there that's a real quirky quirky house yeah what what makes you say it's there like what do you get out of it um i mean all the all the cabinets are like handmade and they're like odd shapes and there's like doors to nowhere and strange like car doors and tunnels and really odd odd paintings on the wall and um yeah did you ever live in it it's very quirky i did live in it briefly yeah but why do you buy houses like if you own all these houses do you just get bored and go i think i'd like to have that well i you know had one house and then the junior wilder house right across the road from me from from my main house and it was going to get it was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into you know be a big construction zone for three years and i was like well i think i'll i'll buy it and preserve the spurt of gene water and not have a giant construction zone and then the you know this i started having like some privacy issues where like people would like less people just like come to my house and you know start climbing over the walls and stuff i feel like man um so then i saw like what a house some of the houses around my house and then i thought at one point well you know it'd be cool to to build a house so then i acquired some properties at the top of samara road uh and which is got a great view and it's like okay well these some bunch of sort of small older houses they're going to get torn down anyway i was like well you know if i collect these like little little houses then i can build something you know i don't know artistic like a you know dream house type of thing what's a dream house for elon musk like some tony stark type [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah definitely yeah you gotta have the the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing you know yeah for sure [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah yeah um but but then i was like man do i really want does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and i'd be real you know get out like ocd on the little details and the design and or should i be allocating that time to getting us to mars i should probably do the latter so you know like what's more important mars or a house i like mars okay is that really how you think like that it'd be better off planning on a trip to mars or getting people to mars yeah yeah definitely i mean you can only do so many things right right so how you can i don't know how you do what you do anyway i don't i don't understand how you can run bull with a boring company tesla spacex all these different things you're doing constantly i just i don't understand i mean you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and and how hectic it is and insane i still don't the the productivity is uh baffling just doesn't make sense how you can get so much done well i think i do have high productivity but even with that there's still some upgraded cost of time and allocating time to building a house even if it was a really great house it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to mars and helping sell sustainable energy uh spacex and tesla are by far you know by the the most amount of like brain cycles um you know boring company does not take you know like less than one percent of brain cycles and um and then this neural link which is i don't know maybe it's like five percent and then five percent that's that's a good chunk it's a good chunk yeah yeah we were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live when it's actually going to be available are you testing on people right now no we're not testing people yet but i i think it won't be too long i think we may be able to implant a neurolink in less than a year in a person i think and when you do this is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to to see what percentage of people's bodies are going to reject these things is it put is it there is there a potential for rejection it's a very low potential for rejection i mean you can think of it like people put in you know heart monitors and um you know things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation um obviously like you know artificial hips and right knees and that kind of thing so the probability of i mean like it's so it's well known like what will cause rejection what what will not um it's definitely harder when you've got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that's that's generating a current pulse and reading current pulses that's that's a little harder um then then say uh passive device but it's still you know very doable and um yeah there there are people who have primitive devices in in their brains right now what kind of devices i like deep brain stimulation is i think for parkinson's is like has really changed people's lives in a big way um which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain um it's like kicking the tv type of thing um and you think like man kicking the tv shouldn't work it does sometimes yeah yeah the old old tvs it did my grandpa used to slap the top for sure yeah it would work sometimes yeah so this deep right simulation uh implanted devices in the brain that uh have changed people's lives for the better like fundamentally well let's talk about what you can talk about to what neurolink is because the last time you were here you really couldn't discuss it and then there was a i guess a press release or something that sort of outlined yeah that that happened quite a bit after the last time you were here so what exactly is it how do you do what what happens if someone ultimately does get a neurolink installed what will take place well for version one of the device it would be it basically implanted in your skull so but it would be flush with your skull so you basically uh take out a chunk of skull replace put the neurologic device in there um you put the the electrode you'd insert the electrode threads very carefully into the the brain and uh and then you you know stitch it up and um and you wouldn't even know that somebody has it and then and and so then it it can interface basically anywhere in any anywhere in your brain um so it could be something that uh you know helps cure say uh eyesight like give you returns your eyesight even if you've like lost your optic nerve type of thing uh really yeah yeah absolutely hearing obviously um i mean pretty much anything that where that it could in principle fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain and it could restore uh limb functionality so if you've got uh interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that's say that's like a microcontroller and near muscle groups uh you you could then create a sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who's a quadriplegic to full functionality like they can walk around be normal whoa yeah so maybe slightly better slightly better over time yes you mean with future iterations like the you know six million dollar man although these days that would that doesn't matter yeah six billion dollars so the the hole would be small how big would the hole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece it's only one hole well um yeah the device we're working on right now is about it's about an inch in diameter um and your skull is pretty thick by the way so skulls are mine is for sure it might actually literally um i mean if you're a big if you're a big guy your skull is actually fairly thick um skulls like it's like seven to 14 millimeters um so that's probably a couple inches a half inch you know half inch thick skull ish so um yeah yeah so that's a fair bit of like our we got quite a coconut going on here it's not it's not like some egg shell oh yeah i believe you um so the yeah you basically implant the device uh and so you would be like a one inch square one inch in diameter yeah like so an inch circle like a circular yeah i think like a like a smart watch or something like that okay yeah okay so you take this one-inch diameter like ice fishing right you ever go ice fishing um no but i'd like to it's great yeah it's really fun so you basically take an auger and you you drill through the surface of the ice yeah and you create a small hole and you can dunk your line in there so this is like that you're ice fishing on the top of your skull and then you cork it yeah and you replace that say one inch diameter piece of skull with this neural link device and that has a battery and a and a bluetooth and a inductive charger um and then you and and now then you also got to insert the electrodes uh so the electrode is very carefully inserted uh with our with a robot that we developed uh that's you know very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding you know and any veins or arteries uh so it's you know doesn't create trauma so through this one-inch diameter device electrodes be inserted and they will find their way like tiny wires basically tiny wires and they'll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate no you literally put them where they're supposed to go oh okay yeah how long will these wires be uh i mean they usually go in like you know depending on where it is like you know two or three millimeters so they just find the spots yeah wow um and then um yeah then you put the device in and that that gets uh that that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out uh and then you you stitch up the hole and and um and you just have it look like a little scar and that's it well this would be replaceable or reversible yes like if someone can't take it anymore i'm too smart i can't take it yeah you can totally check it out and what is the besides restoring limb function and eyesight and hearing which are all amazing is there are there any cognitive benefits that you anticipate from something like this uh yeah i mean you could for sure um uh i mean basically it's a generalized um sort of uh thing for for fixing any kind of brain injury in in principle like if you or if you've got like like severe epilepsy or something like that it could it could just it could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring like it could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy um if um i mean there's a whole range of brain injuries like if somebody gets a stroke they could lose the ability to speak um you know that that'll stack could also be fixed so if you've got like stroke damage or if you lose say you know muscle control over part of your face or something like that i think and then when when you get old you tend to if you get like you know alzheimer's or something like that then you lose memory and this could help you with you know restoring your memory that kind of thing restoring memory and what what is happening that's allowing it to do that like the wires these small wires stimulating these areas of the brain and then is it that the areas of the brain are they're they're losing some sort of electrical force like what it what is happening yeah yeah it's it's like it's like i think it's like a bunch of circuits and there's some like circuits that are broken and we can like uh fix those circuits substitute for those circuit circuits and so a specific frequency will go through this yeah specific in that would is the process figuring out how much or how little has to be how how much these areas of the brain have to be juiced up yeah i mean there's still a lot of work to do so when i say you know we got a shot at probably putting it in in a person in you know a within a year i think that's that's what that's exactly what i mean i think we have a chance of putting input into one and having them having them be healthy and and restoring some functionality that they've lost the fear is that eventually you're gonna have to cut the whole top of someone's head off and put a new top with a whole bunch of wires if you want to get you know the real turbocharged version the p100d of brain stimulation i mean ultimately if you if you want to go with full ai symbiosis you'll probably want to do something like that symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to ai it's optional [Laughter] i would hope so yeah it's just i mean once you enjoy the dr manhattan lifestyle once you once you become a god seems very very unlikely you're going to want to go back to being stupid again i mean you you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other yes yes you wouldn't need to talk i'm so scared of that but so excited about it at the same time is that weird yeah i mean the i think this is one of the paths to um you know i think like what like ai is getting better and better um so now let's assume it's sort of like a benign ai scenario even in a benign scenario we're kind of left behind you know we're we're not we're not along for the ride um we're just too dumb right so so how do you go along for the ride um yeah so you can't beat them join them so um and we're already we're already a cyborg to some degree right because you've got your phone you've got your laptop glasses yeah yeah guitar electronic devices and i mean today if you your phone if you if you don't bring your phone along it's like you have missing limb syndrome that's like you know it feels like something's really really missing so we're already partly um part you know partly a cyborg um or an ai symbiote essentially um it's just that the data rate to the electronics is slow so especially output like you're just going with your thumbs i don't know like what's your data rate maybe optimistically 100 bits per second that's being generous um and now the computer can communicate at like you know 100 terabits you know so so certainly you know gigabits are a trivial at this point so this this is like you know basically your computer could do a mil do things a million times faster or at a certain point it's like talk they as like talking to a tree okay it's boring you talk to a tree it's very not very entertaining um so um so if you if you can solve the the data rate issue and your especially output but input two then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between mana machine so you you can improve it in what when you said you won't have to talk to each other anymore we used to joke around about that i i've joked around about that a million times in this podcast that one day in the future there's going to come a time where you can read each other's minds and well you'll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a non-verbal non-physical way where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth and make noises exactly so when you like what happens when you when like let's say you've got some complex idea that you're trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that well your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there's a there's a lot a lot of loss information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words and then you say those words those words are then interpreted then they're decompressed by the person who is listening and they they will at best get a very incomplete understanding of what you're trying to convey it's very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you've got compression decompression you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult you know what we have here is a failure to communicate cool and luke yes and there's a great movie yeah there's an interpretation factor too like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in in different ways and they're dependent upon tone dependent upon social cues even facial expressions sarcasm there's a lot of variables sarcasm is difficult yes yeah and so one of the things that i i've said is like that there could be potentially a universal language that's created through computers that particularly young kids would pick up very quickly like my kids do tick tock and all this jazz and i don't know what they're doing they just know how to do it and they know how to do it really quickly like they learn really quickly they show me how to edit things and yeah it's if you taught a child from first grade on how to use some new universal language i mean essentially like a rosetta stone and something that's done that interprets your thoughts and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation with clear very clear that where you know what a person's saying and you can tell them what you're saying and there's no need for noises no need for mouth noises no need for these sort of accepted ways that we've uh sort of evolved to make sounds that we all agree we through our cultural dictionary right we agree or certainly we could bypass all that yeah we can still do it for for sentimental reasons right like campfires yeah yeah exactly i don't need campfires i don't need to roast marshmallows kind of fun right um so yeah um yeah i think you would in principle you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas and language would i'm not sure what would happen to language but you could probably within a situation like this that you would be able to just kind of like the matrix you you want to speak a different language in a problem right that's why it just downloaded the program right so at least for the first iterations first few iterations we'll just be able to use like i i know that google has uh their some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time sure yeah you can hear it and they'll it'll play things back to you in whatever language you choose so to be something along those lines yeah for the first few iterations well the first few iterations are i mean what i'm talking about is like in the limit over time you know with a lot of development um the first few iterations really in the first few versions all we're going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries um so so it's like don't don't worry that that's not going to sneak up on you this this will take a while how many years before you don't have to talk if the if the development continues to accelerate then maybe like five years five to ten years that's quick that's really quick that's the best case scenario no talking anymore in five years best case scenario but i'm 10 10 years more like it i've always speculated that aliens could potentially be us in the future because if you look at like the size their heads and the fact that they have very little muscle and then they don't use their mouth anymore they was tiny little i mean the archetypal alien that you see in like closing counters are the third kind they they're like if you went from like uh australopithecus or ancient hominid to us what's the difference less hair less muscle bigger head and then just keep going a thousand a million whatever you or five years whatever whatever happens when neurolink goes on online and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don't use our muscles anymore we have this gigantic head we can talk without words you could also save state and save state save state like save your brain state like like a saved game in a video game whoa like like if you want to swap from windows 95 well yeah i think we are windows 95 right now yeah from a future perspective probably um but yeah i mean you you could save state um and restore that state into a biological being if you if you wanted to in the future in principle it's like nothing like from a physics standpoint that prevents us now you'd be a little different but then you're also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you're a little different in fact if you say like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference yes um so you'd be substantially you i mean you'd be you'd certainly think you're you but the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state like you can hang out with 30 year old you i mean the possibilities are endless that's so weird i mean these things think like how your phone can you can record videos on your phone like there's no way you could remember a video right as accurately as your phone or a camera you know could so uh now if you've got like a you know some some you know version 10 hero link whatever and far in the future you could you could remember you could recall everything but just like it's a movie concluding all the entire sensory experience emotions everything everything everything and play it back and you can enjoy it you should edit it edit it yeah so you can change your past you could change what do you think was your past yeah well so if you had like a tremendous thing right now could be a replayed memory it could be yeah it may be what's the odds of this being a replayed memory if you had a guess it's more than 50 there's no way to assign a probability with accuracy here right but roughly if you just had a just gut instinct well i don't have a neural link in my brain so i say right now zero percent but at the point at which you do have a neural link then it rises above zero percent the idea that we're experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is uh even though it's still the same it's not comforting right for some reason when we people talk about simulation theory they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation it even though your life might be wonderful you might be in love you might love your career you might have great friends but it's not comforting to know that this experience somehow or another doesn't exist in a material form that you can knock on it feels real doesn't it feels real but but if it's not but the idea that it's not is for some strange reason disconcerting well yeah i'm sure it should be disconcerting because then if this is not real what is right um but but the you know there's that that old sort of um thought experiment of like how do you know you're not a brain in a vet you know i mean now here's the thing you are a brain an event then that fat is your skull yes and everything you see feel here everything all your senses are electrical signals everything everything is an electrical signal to up to a brain in a vat where the vat is called and all your hormones all your neurotransmitters all these things are drugs adrenaline's a drug dopamine's a drug you're a drug factory you're constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and and beauty sure changes your state great music changes your state absolutely and yet here's another sort of interesting idea which is um because you say like where did consciousness arise well assuming you believe the belief in physics which appears to be true um then you know we the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and of helium lithium like basically elements the periodic table but it was like mostly hydrogen basically and then and then over a long period of time uh you know 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient but so where along the way that conju where is the consciousness what's the line of consciousness and not consciousness right between hydrogen and here right when do we call it when do we call it consciousness i was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle down the street jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby yeah i saw that one they went apparel what is that monkey conscious it seems like it is it seems like it had a plan it was riding a [\u00a0__\u00a0] motorcycle and then jumped off the motorcycle to try to steal a baby seems pretty the one that just strike baby down the street pretty far yeah yeah seems pretty conscious right there's definitely some degree of consciousness there yeah it's not like it's not a worm it seems to be on another level yeah and it's going to keep going and that that's the real concern when when people think about the potential future versions of human beings especially when you consider symbiotic relationship to artificial intelligence it will be unrecognizable that one day we'll be so far removed from what this is we'll look back on this the way we look back now on you know simple simple organisms that we evolved from and then it won't be that far in the future that we do have this this view back well i hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more more sophisticated and complex and and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe do you think that's the case as a human being as yourself you're clearly trying to make conscious decisions to be a better version of you right this is the idea of like getting rid of your possessions and realizing that you're trying to like i don't like this i will try to improve this i will try to do a better version of the way i interface with reality that this is always the way things are if you're if you're moving in a some sort of a direction where you're trying to improve things you're always going to move into this new place where you look back in the old place and go i was doing it wrong back then so this is an accelerated version of that super accelerated version of that i mean you don't always improve but you can aspire to improve you can aspire to be less wrong yeah this is like i think a good the tools of physics are very powerful like just assume you're wrong and you're asking your goals to be less wrong i don't think you're gonna if you succeed every day and being less wrong but you know if you're gonna succeed in being less wrong most of the time you're doing great that's a great way of putting aspire to be less wrong but then when you know people look back at nostalgia about simpler times there's that too it's very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires but you can still have a campfire yes yeah but will you appreciate it when you're a super nerd when you're connected to the grid and you have some uh skull cap in place of the top of your head and it's interfacing with the inter international language that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people and we're yeah sure i think so yeah i like empires [Laughter] i'm just worried i mean uh everyone's always scared of change but i'm scared of this monumental change where we won't we won't talk anymore i mean that thing will communicate yes but that's there's something about there's something about the beauty of the crudeness of language where when it's done eloquently it's it's it's satisfying and it it it hits us in some sort of a visceral way like ah that person nailed it i love that they nailed it like that it's so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way in this articulate way that makes someone except like you read a quote a great quote by a wise person it makes you excited that their mind figured something out put the words together in a right way that makes your brain pop like oh yes yeah yes it's clever compression of a concept yeah and a feeling but the fact that a human did it too yeah absolutely do you think that it'll be like electronic music like people won't appreciate it like they appreciate a slide guitar i like electronic music i do too yeah well you make it i know you liked it yeah yeah yeah um yeah i mean i hope the future is more fun and interesting and we should try to make that way i hope it's more fun and interesting too yeah i just you know i just hope you don't lose anything along the way yeah we might at least little but hopefully we'll gain more than lose yeah that's the thing right gaining more than we lose like something that makes us interesting is that we're so flawed it's not for sure right yeah i mean you look at civilizations through the ages um most of them uh you know they rose and fell yeah and uh i do think like the globalization uh that that we have at the sort of like the the meme sphere uh is uh there's not enough isolation between countries or regions um it's like if you get up if there's a mind virus that that my virus cannot infect too much of the world uh you know like i actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people because it's it's like man we don't ever want everywhere to be the same for sure and then we we need some kind of like mind viral immunity so that that's it's a bit concerning mind viral immunity meaning that once something like neural link gets established the real concern is something that i mean you said it's bluetooth right or some future version of that that the idea is that something could possibly get into it [\u00a0__\u00a0] it up no i'm talking about like uh somebody there's some cockeyed concept that um that's happened that happens right right now yeah well i know there's viruses and embedded chips right like people have they've embedded chips and then acquired viruses well when i'm talking about my verse i'm talking about like a a concept that affects people's minds oh okay okay like uh cult thinking or yeah some sort of fundamentalism yeah just wrong-headed idea that yes goes viral in a in an idea sense [Music] well that is that is a problem too right if someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational yeah yeah that would that be an issue too with this is a very have versus have not issue right once this thing if if this really does i mean initially it's going to help people with with injuries and but you you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change yes but the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don't have it yet well i mean it's the kind of thing where your productivity would improve i don't know dramatically maybe by a factor of 10 with it so you could definitely just you know uh i don't know take out a loan and do it and earn earn the money back real fast so you're super smart well in a capitalist society you know you could it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well you'd be so far ahead they could never catch you is that a concern uh well i think the the it's not a super huge concern i mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and and resources already yeah um i mean you can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective uh that's far smarter than an individual like i i can personally build like a whole rocket and and the engines and launch it and everything that's impossible uh but you know we have eight thousand people with spacex and you might you know piecing it out to different people um and using like you know computers and machines and stuff we can make lots of rockets launch and all but stuck with the space station that kind of thing you know um so that already exists where this you know where there's a corporations are vastly more capable than an individual um but the the like we should be i think less concerned about like relative capabilities between people and and more like uh having ai be vastly you know beyond us and decoupled from human will decoupled from human so this is the if you can't beat them join them yeah i mean so you feel like it's inevitable like ai sentient ai is essentially inevitable super sentient ai yeah like beyond a level that's difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably and somehow or another us so it's almost like it's a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with ai it's not a requirement it's just um if you if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis so the the way your brain works right now you've got uh kind of like the animal brain reptile brain kind of let's say it's like the limbic system basically and you've got the the cortex um now the brain purists will argue with this definition but essentially you've got the primitive brain and you've got the the sort of smart brain or the brain that's capable of planning and understanding concepts and different difficult you know things that a monkey can't understand um now the your cortex is much much smarter than your olympic system um nonetheless they work together well so i haven't met anyone who wants to delete the olympic system or the cortex that people are quite happy having both um so you can think of the this as being like the computer the ai is like a a third layer a tertiary layer so that is like that could be symbiotic with the cortex it'd be much smarter than the cortex but you'd essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable things that your brain is definitely not you know storing your terabytes of information perfectly um doing incredible calculations that you you know we couldn't even come close to doing you have that with your computer it's just like i said the data rate is slow the connection is weak why is it so disconcerting or why is it why does it not give me comfort to think about like when i think about a symbiotic connection to ai i always think of this cold emotionless sort of thing that we will become is that a bad way to look at it i don't think that's not that's not quite that's not how it would be like i said you you already are yeah symbiotic with ai or computers phones computers laptops yeah and there's there's quite a bit of ai going on you know near so artificial neural nets um increasingly neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more so you are connected um you know if you use google voice or alexa or one of those things it's using a neural net to decode your speech and try to understand what you're saying um you know if if you're trying to image recognition or improve the quality of photograph it's it's using the neural nets the best way to do that so um you are already uh sort of a sort of a cybernetic symbiote it like said you when that it's just a question of your data rate the the the communication speed between your your phone and your brain is slow when do you think you're gonna do it how long will you wait um like once it starts becoming available yeah if it works i'll do it sure right away i mean let's make sure it works how do we make sure it works we're trying on prisoners like what do you do no no you take rapists no cut holes in your head now like i said if somebody's got a serious brain injury right um and though you know people have like very severe brain injuries um and then and then you can fix those those brain injuries um and you know then you prove out that it works and you expand envelope expand and make more and more brain injuries uh sold more and more um and that you know suddenly at certain age we all are are going to get alzheimer's we're all going to get senile um and then you know moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing and so you know it's like you said okay well you know this would allow you to remember your names your kids and and and have a normal a much more normal life where you you you're able to function much later in life um so i think that so essentially that there would almost everyone would find a need at some point if if you get old enough to use your neural link and and and then it's like okay so we can improve the functionality and improve the communications communication speed so then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer do you ever sit down extrapolate do you ever like sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to um yeah i mean i think sure think about a lot um there's like i said this is not something that's going to sneak up on you you know there's like getting fda approval for this stuff is not like overnight you know um and this there's i mean we probably have to be on like version 10 or something before you know it it would realistically be um you know a human ai symbiote situation so you'll see it coming you know you see it coming but what do you think it's going to be like when you sit when you're alone if you have free time i don't know if you have free time but if you just sit down and think about this iteration the next onward keep going and you you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations and where do you see it what are we going to be like when 20 25 years from now what are we going to be well assuming civilization is still around um it's looking fragile right now um i think we i think we could have a in 25 years probably something i think like that could be a whole brain interface a whole brain interface sorry pretty close to that yeah how does how do you define what do you mean by whole brain interface um like almost all the neurons are connected to uh you're the sort of ai extension of yourself if you want ai extension of yourself yeah what does that mean to you like when you say ai extension of yourself well you like i said you already have a computer extension of yourself in your phone you know and computers and stuff so and now online it's like somebody dies there's this like an online ghost that they're they're still their online stuff yeah it's alive that's a good way to put it it is weird when you read someone's tweets after they're dead yeah yeah instagram and their stories and stuff yeah whatever facebook inside you know like that's a great way to put it it's like an online ghost that's very accurate yeah so yeah so there's it would just be that that more of you would be in the cloud i guess than in your body more of it more of you whoa now when you say civilization's fragile do you mean because of this covet 19 [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's going on right now what's that i've never heard of it it's this thing yeah no it's like uh some people just get a card other people it gets much worse uh sure yeah well yeah i mean this certainly has taken over the mayan space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking yeah well out of nowhere that's what's crazy it's like you go back to november nothing now here we are december january february march april may six months totally different world so from nothing to everything's locked down there's so much uh conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed what what has happened you you find things where there was a meat packing plant i believe in missouri where 300 plus people were asymptomatic tested positive or asymptomatic and then in other places it just ravages entire communities and kills people and it's it's so weird it almost appears on the out like if you didn't know any better you'd be like what it seems like there's a bunch of different viruses it doesn't seem like it's the same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of of people yeah um i mean i kind of saw this whole thing play out in china uh before it played out in the us so um it's kind of like watching the same movie again but in english um so yeah um i might i think the the the the mortality rate is much less than what is then what say the world health organization said it was it's very much module assets like probably at least order of magnitude less well it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems yeah i mean if you're you can look at the mortality statistics you know by age and whether they have comorbid comorbidities like do they have like basically existing conditions and um by age um and uh you know if you're below 60 and and have no serious health issues the probability of death is extremely low it's not zero but it's extremely low they didn't think that this was the case though when they first started to lock down the country do you think that it's a situation where once they've proceeded in a certain way it's very difficult to correct course it's almost like people really wanted a panic that you know quite quite crazy but in some places a panic is deserved right like if you're in the icu in manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone's on intubators and it's it's it seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick in some places that fear is justified but then in other places you're reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty they're they're having to furlough doctors and nurses because there's no work for them most of the hospitals in the united states right now half empty in some cases they're at 30 capacity and is this because they've decided to forego elective procedures and and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for yes i mean we're not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important like it's like you have about a lot of disease yeah sure and you need a you know triple bypass it's like sort of elective but if you don't get it done in time it's you're gonna die yeah it's elective is a weird word yeah elective it's not like hey i i want to it's not like plastic surgery it's more like like my my hip is i'm in extreme pain because my my hips blown out or my knee and i don't want to go to the hospital i can't go to the hospital to you know people in extreme pain people that need a kidney you know like people that have like quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear um so i think it's it's a problem it's not good it seems like the state of public perception is shifting it is like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics of i mean and essentially across the board it's being recognized that it's not as fatal as we thought it was still dangerous still worse than the flu but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be i mean objectively the mortality is is much lower like at least a factor of 10 maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought do you think that the current way we're handling this the social distancing the mass the locking down is it does this make sense is it adequate or do you think that we should move back to at least closer to where we used to be well i think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what you know wash your hands and you know and if you're if you're coughing stay home or wear a mask this is not good you know um like they do that in japan that's like normal if you're if you're ill you you wear a face mask and you don't cough on people i think that that would be a great thing to to adopt in general throughout the world um washing your hands is also good well that's the speculation why men get it more than women because men are disgusting and we don't watch that disgusting it's true it's true yeah we're all my men in this room we're all gross yeah let's go to the restroom you can see us yes we're gross my daughter my nine-year-old daughter yells at me she goes did you wash your hands she makes me go back and wash my hands hmm she's right nine years old if i had a nine-year-old boy do you think he would care i wouldn't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] if i wash my hands true um so yeah i think that there's definitely some silver linings here than in improved uh you know uh hygiene yeah and an awareness of potential yes and i think this has shaken up the the system uh system is like somewhat more bond with la la's layers of bureaucracy and i think that we've cut through some of that bureaucracy uh and if we you know at some point there probably will be a uh pandemic with with a with a high mortality rate uh debate about like what's high but i mean like someone that's killing a lot of 20 year olds let's say like it's yeah if you had like ebola type of mortality spanish flu something that uh tax immune systems of healthy people yeah yeah um yeah but it's a yeah like like killing large numbers of young healthy people that that's you know define that as like uh uh high mortality then that this is at least practice for something like that um and i think there's this you know given it's just a matter of time that there will be eventually some some such pandemic do you think that in a sense the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality that we we got lucky in this sense i mean in people that didn't get lucky and died of course i'm not disrespecting their death and their loss but i'm saying overall as a as a culture as a community as a human race as a community this is not as bad as it could have been this is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards the the understanding these diseases what to do in the case of pandemic and much more money that goes to funding treatments and and some preventative measures yeah absolutely um and i think i think there's a good chance it's highly likely i think coming out of this that we will develop uh vaccines that we didn't have before uh for uh quran viruses and other other viruses um and and possibly cures uh for for these and our understanding of uh viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it's received so there's definitely some you know a lot of silver linings here um and potentially if we act correctly yeah yeah yeah there's uh i think there will be some amounts of lighting here no matter what um hopefully it can be more professive lighting than less yeah um so yeah this is this is uh it's like kind of like a practice run for something that had that that had a potential that might in the future have a serious uh like a really high mortality rate that and we kind of got to go through this with without without it being something that kills you know vast numbers of young healthy people yeah when you made a series of tweets recently uh you know uh i don't remember the exact wording but essentially you were saying free america now like let's think about that is it thank you but uh the the you know what was the how much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff and what was the response like did anybody go hey elon what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you doing did anybody pull you aside who does that who gets to do that to you well i mean i certainly get that there's no shortage of negative feedback on twitter you know oh yeah twitter yeah but i don't read that do you read it warzone you do sometimes though right you do read it yeah i mean scroll through the comments like as a meme warzone yeah i mean people knife you're good it's something i i enjoy about that just the there's a something about the the freedom of expression that comes from all these people that do attack you it's like well they if there was no vulnerability whatsoever they wouldn't attack you and it's like there's something about these millions and millions of perspectives that you you have to you have to appreciate even if it comes your way even if the [\u00a0__\u00a0] storm hits you in the face sure you gotta appreciate wow how amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves you don't don't necessarily want to be there when the [\u00a0__\u00a0] hits you sure you might want to get out of the way in anticipation of the [\u00a0__\u00a0] storm but the fact that so many people have the ability to reach out and i think it's in a lot of ways it's uh i don't wanna say a misused resource but it's like giving monkeys guns they just start they start gunning down things that in front of them without any realization of what they're doing they have a rock they see a window they throw it whoa look at that i got elon madd look at that this guy got mad at me this this i i [\u00a0__\u00a0] took this person down on twitter i got this lady fired oh the [\u00a0__\u00a0] business is going under because of twitter wars it seems like there's something about it that's this newfound thing that uh i want to say abuse but just i want to say that it's almost like you know you hit the button and things blow up you're like wow this is what else can we blow up sure um i mean i've been in the twitter war zone for for a while here so put your war zone you know take it takes a lot to phase me at this point yeah that's good too right like you develop a thick skin yeah you can't take it personally these people don't like actually know you you know like yeah it's just like you know so it's like if you're if you're fighting a war and there's like some opposing soldier that that shoots shoots at you it's not like they hate you they don't even know you right yeah yeah so just think of it like that like they're firing bullets or whatever um but they don't know you so don't take it personally there's something interesting about it too it's like uh like when you write something in you know 280 characters and they write something into it it's such a crude way it's like you know someone's saying sending opposing smoke signals that refute your smoke signals it's like it's so crude and especially when you're talking about something like neural link he's talking about some future potential where you're going to be able to express pure thoughts that get get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus you know tweets well there'll always be some ambiguity but yeah tweets are it's hard um like the maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something you know right right um or i'm not you know just kidding or whatever you know like don't you know it seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it's sarcasm like if everybody knew that the onion wasn't real if you sent people articles yeah is something about someone getting angry at an onion article wow that's amazing you know what i mean where they don't realize what it is there's something fun about that for everybody else uh yeah i know it's pretty great it might be the best news source do you know who titania mcgrath is hilario it's uh andrew boyle he's a uh a british fellow a brilliant guy who's been on the podcast before and he has this uh fictional character this uh pseudonym titania mcgrath who's like this all the ultimate social justice warrior is this like like a female avatar a female avatar that's actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces okay it's not really one person so one person can't be a victim and be angry he's sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice more okay but the thing like i recognized it early on before i met him sure that this was parody this is this was just fun and then i love reading the people that don't recognize that they get angry sure and then they're really really like there's a lot of people that just get really furious sure about some of some fun to that there's some fun to the not picking up on the the the true nature of the signal i find twitter quite engaging how do you have the time um well i mean it's like five minutes every couple hours type of thing it's not like i'm sitting on an old day but even five minutes every couple hours if those are bad five minutes they might be bouncing around your head for the next 30. yeah you have to you know like i said take a certain amount of distance from you read this and you're like okay it's bullets being fired by an opposing army you know don't like it it's not like they they like so it's not like they know you it's like don't take it personally um did you feel the same way when when cnn had that stupid [\u00a0__\u00a0] about ventilators with you i i found that both confusing and the the the yeah that was annoying it was annoying but what is also annoying as a person who reads cnn and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts i would like to think that yeah i don't think cnn is that i think he used to be he used to be yeah um like what do you think's the the best source of just like information out there that's a good question you know like let's say you're just like average citizen trying to just get the facts you know figure out what's going on like you know how to live your life and you know just looking for what what's going on in the world that it's hard to find something that that isn't you know that's that that's good yeah you know uh that you know not not trying to push some partisan angle not trying to not not sort of doing sloppy reporting and and just aiming for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing yeah you're just trying to figure out what's going on it's like i'm hard pressed where do you go i don't know i don't think there's any pure form my favorite places are the new york times and the la times and i don't trust them 100 percent you know because also there's individuals that are writing these stories exactly and that's seems to be the problems these individual biases and these individual there's purposely distorted perceptions and then there's ignorantly reported facts and there's so many variables and you got to put everything through this filter of where is this person coming from do they have political biases do they have social biases do they are they are they upset because of their own shortcomings and they are they projecting this into the story sure it's so hard yeah i think like maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and yeah kind of falling down as opposed to the publication i go with whatever matt taibbi says okay i trust him more than anybody all right matt taib he's onto something i just he's as far as investigative reporters in particular the way he reported the savings and loan crisis the way he reports everything i just i just listen to him above most above mo he's my go-to guy all right i'll check it out uh it's rolling stone's articles or his stuff on the savings alone crisis just like what in the [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you know and he wasn't you know he's not an economist by any stretch of the imagination so he had to really sort of deeply embed himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it and was also with a humorous flair for now that's nice yeah um yeah but it's not that many of them there's it's hard and not a location where like we are no [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's right you know we are no bullshit.com like the one place where you can say this is what we know this is what we don't know this is what we think not this person's wrong and here's why like oh god damn it you know i can't you you don't know there's a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation yeah this this particular coronavirus issue that we're dealing with right now seems to be a great illuminator of that very fact is that there's so much data and there's this so there's so much that's open to interpret there's so many thing because it's all happening in real time right and like particularly right now in california we're in stage two tomorrow or friday two days from now stage two retail stores opening up things are changing like when no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives but yet ensure that our our culture and that our our our economy survives it's a lot of speculation and guessing but if you go to certain places they'll tell you we know why and we know this and we know uh it's hard yeah i mean i in general i think that's like we should be concerned about um anything that's a massive infringement on our civil civil liberties yes you know so it's like you got to put a lot of weight on that um you know people a lot of people died to you know win independence with the country and and fight for the democracy that we have and uh you know we should treasure that and not and not give up our liberties too easily i think we've we i mean i think we probably did that actually well i like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home require people to not go to work require and to to arrest people for trying to make a living this all seems wrong and i think it's a wrong approach it's a it's uh you're you're it's an infantilization of the society that daddy's going to tell you what to do fundamentally a violation of the constitution yeah freedom of assembly and you know it's just i mean i don't think these things stand up in court really they're arresting people for protesting yeah yeah because they're protesting and violating social distancing and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home yeah these these are these would definitely not stand up uh you know if the supreme court here i mean it's obviously a complete violation right yeah yeah and again this is not in any way um disrespecting the people who have died from this disease that's certainly a real thing to think of yeah i mean it it it just should be if if you're if you're at risk you should not be compelled to leave your house right um or leave a place of safety but you should also not be uh if you're not at risk or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life you should have the right to do that and it seems like at this point in time particularly our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life the way they did particularly having a career and and making a living and feeding your family paying your bills keeping your store open keeping your restaurant open yes i mean there's there's a strong a strong downside to this yeah so yeah i just believe like you know if this is a free country you should be you know a lot allowed to do you know what you want as long as it does not endanger others but that's the thing right people this is the argument they will bring up like you are endangering others you should stay home for the people that that you even if you're fine even if you know you're gonna be okay there's certain people that will not be okay because of your actions they might get exposed to this thing that we don't have a vaccine for we don't have universally accepted treatment for and then we need to ca this is there's two arguments right the one argument is we need to keep going protect the weak protect the sick but let's open up the economy the other argument is stop placing money over human lives and let's shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision and let's figure out some way to develop some sort of universal income universal basic income plan or something like that to feed people during the during this time when we make this transition i think there's a yeah um as i said right yeah my opinion is if if somebody wants to stay home they should stay home and say something doesn't want to stay home they should not be compelled to stay home that's my opinion do you think if somebody doesn't like that well that's my opinion um so the now yeah um the the this notion though that uh you know you can just sort of send checks out everybody and and things will be fine it's not true obviously um the there's some people have this absurd like a view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty like it it just makes stuff stuff you know whatever it just there's a magic quarter plenty and the goods and services they just come from this magic corner plenty and then if um like if somebody has more stuff than somebody else's because they took more from this magic corner plenty now let me uh just break it to uh the fools out there if you don't make stuff there's no stuff yeah so if you don't make the food if you don't process the food you know transport the food and what the whether you know medical treatment getting getting your teeth fixed there's no stuff i become detached from reality you can't just legislate money and solve these things if you don't make stuff there is no stuff obviously we'll run out of the stores run out of the you know it's the whole the machine just grinds to a halt but the the initial thought on this virus the real fear was that this was going to kill hundreds of thousands if not millions of people instantaneously in this country it was going to do it very quickly if we didn't hunker down if we didn't shelter in place if we didn't quarantine ourselves or lock down do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be maybe i think briefly briefly briefly but uh i think if you know any any kind of like sensible examination of what happened in china would lead to the conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur uh this this virus originated in wuhan there's like i don't know hundred thousand people a day leaving on uh so it that that it it uh it went everywhere very fast through throughout china throughout the rest of the world um and the fatality rate was was low don't you think though it's difficult to appreciate it's it's it's difficult to filter what the information is coming out of china to accurately really get a real true representation of what happened the the propaganda machine is very strong sure what the world health organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda the thing is that american companies have massive supply chains in china like tesla for example we have hundreds of suppliers like tier one two three four suppliers throughout throughout china so we know if they are able to make stuff or not we know if they if they have issues or not then they they're china is back back at full steam um and until many uh pretty much every u.s company has some significant number of flies in china so you know you know if they're able to you know provide things or not or if there's you know high mortality rate tesla has seven thousand people in china so zero people died um zero okay so that that's a real statistic that's coming from yeah yeah you know those people yeah we literally we're in payroll do you think there's a danger of this same folks are there yeah do you think there's a danger of politicizing this whereas becomes like opening up the country's uh donald trump's it's his goal it's his and then anything he does is sort of uh there's there's people that are going to oppose it and come up with some reasons why he's wrong particularly in this climate whereas as we're leading up november and you know the the 2020 elections do you think that this is a real danger in terms of uh public's perception that trump wants to open it up so they knee-jerk oppose it because they oppose trump i i think there has been some politician this has been politicized you know in both directions really so it's um which is not great yeah but like i said separate apart from that i think there's the question of like you know where do several civil liberties fit in this picture you know yeah and uh what what what can the government make you do what can they make you not do and what you know what's what's okay right um and uh yeah i think we went too far do you think it's one of those things where once we've gone in a certain direction it's very difficult to make a correction make a an adjustment to to realize like okay we thought it was one thing it's not it's not good but it's not what we thought it was going to be it's not what we feared so let's let's back up and reconsider let's do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially that information appears to be faulty and uh here's how we move forward while protecting civil liberties while protecting what essentially this country was founded on which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom yeah that we respect and appreciate absolutely well i think we're we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country um it's going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks so yeah something that would be helpful just add from an informational level is um when reporting uh sort of covet cases to separate out diagnosed with covert versus uh had covert like symptoms yes because the list of symptoms that could be covered at this point is like a mile long so it's like a hard to if you're ill at all it's like it could be covered so just just to give people better information definitely diagnosed with covert or had covered like symptoms we're conflating those two so that one that it looks bigger than it is then uh if somebody dies is was covert a a primary cause of the death or not uh i mean if i mean if somebody has kova gets eaten by a shark we find their arm their arm has covered it's gonna get recorded as a cover death is that real basically not that bad but heart attacks strokes you get hit by a bug cancer if you if you get hit by a bus go to the go to the hospital and die and then find that you have covered you will be recorded as a cover death why would they do that though well right now the so you know the road is hell is the rotel is paid with good intentions i mean he's mostly paid with bad intentions but there's you know some good intentions saving stones in there too um and the the the stimulus bill that was intended to help uh with the hospitals that were being overrun with with with code patients uh created an incentive to record something as covet that is difficult to say no to especially if your hospital is going bankrupt for lack of other patients so the hospitals are in a bind right now there's a bunch of hospitals are they're following doctors as you were mentioning they're you know they're your is half full you're it's hard hard to make ends meet so now you've got like you know if i just check this box i get eight thousand dollars put on a ventilator for five minutes i get thirty nine thousand dollars back or or i to fire some doctors so what's the what's this this is a tough moral quandary it's like what you can do that's the situation we have no what what's the way out of this what do you think is like if if you had the president's ear or if people wanted to just listen to you openly what do you think is the way out of this so let's let's clear up the data clear up the data so like i said uh something should be required as code but only if it is uh somebody has been tested uh has received a positive positive cover test not if they simply have symptoms one of like 100 symptoms and then if if it is a cover death it must be separated or was this was coveted a primary primary reason for death or did they also have stage three cancer heart disease emphysema and got hit by a bus and had covered yeah i've read all this stuff about that about them uh diagnosing people as a covet death despite other variables this is not a this is not a this is not a a question this is what is occurring and where are you reading this from where are you getting this from the public health health officials have literally said this this is not this is not a question mark right but this is never this is unprecedented right like if someone had the flu but also had a heart attack they would assume that that person died of a heart attack yes yeah so this is unprecedented is this because this is such a a popular i don't i don't want to use that word the wrong way but that's what i mean a popular subject and financial incentives yes and like so this is not some sort of it a moral indictment of of sort of hospital administrators it's just they're in it they're they're in a in a tough in a tough spot here um they actually don't have enough patience to to pay everyone for it to with without following following doctors and and firing staff and yeah they're running potentially going bankrupt so so then they're like okay well the stimulus bill says if you know we get all this you know money if we say if if they if it's a cover death i'm like okay they coughed before they died in fact they're not even diagnosed with cover they simply if you had weakness a cough uh shortness of breath but frankly i'm not sure how you die without those things yeah you yeah but there's so many different things that you could attribute to covet too there's so many symptoms there's diarrhea headaches dehydration yeah cough yes but to be clear you you don't even need to have gotten a cover diagram you simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it's covered so then it makes the death count look very high and then we're then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count's super high and not going down like it should be and now so then we we should keep whatever you know keep you know the shelter in place stuff there and and keep people in their home you know confined people to homes so we need to break out of this this we're stuck in a loop yeah and i think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information clarity of information will certainly help but altering perceptions public perception from people that are basically in a panic there's a lot of essentially well at least a month ago we're clearly in a panic i mean right where you know when you look around april 5th april 6th people were really freaking out but here we are may and may people are relaxing a little bit yes they're realizing like hey um i actually know a couple of people that got it it was just a cough and i know some people that got it where nothing happened i know a lot of people have got it i know zero people who died that i mean about no yeah a lot of people got it yeah it's it's not what we feared we feared something much worse yeah that's correct so the adjustment's difficult to make so you said first of all we need real data we need just just parse out the data don't don't lump it all together no and then if if you give if you get people just parse out the data better clear clearer information um about uh like i said was this an actual code of a diagnosis or was it a or did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms just parse those two out um and then parse out just uh if somebody died did they die did they did they even have a covet test or or did they just have one of many symptoms like like like how do you die without weakness i don't know right it's impossible basically yeah it's a good point if you're gonna die you're gonna have shortness of breath weakness and you might cough a little um so so was it quantified what was it yeah that person did they actually have a covert test and and the tests come back positive and then um if if they died did they uh die where where covert was um it didn't have to be the main course but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death right it's not as simple as just because you had covet covet killed you definitely not right yeah yeah i mean people die all the time and they have like flu and yes you know other colds and well we don't say that they died of those flu and other colds well that's what's so weird absolutely it's so popular and i use that word in a weird way but it's so popular that we've kind of forgotten people die pneumonia every day yeah people die of the flu didn't take a break oh kovitz got this i'm gonna sit this one out i'm gonna be on the bench i'm gonna wait until kovitz done before i jump back into the game of killing people no the flu is still here killing people i mean ev every year in the world several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu yeah not not tangentially right not every 61 000 in this country last year yeah and we're only five percent of the world and then there's cigarettes so oh man cigarettes not cigarettes will really kill you that's a weird one right we're terrified of this disease that were projected it could potentially kill 100 if not 200 000 americans this year with cigarettes kill 500 000 and you don't hear a peep out of any politician there's no one running for congress is trying to ban cigarettes there's no one running for senate that wants to put some education plan in place it's going to stop cigarettes in their tracks yeah i mean a long time like several years ago i mean along with 10 10 years ago i helped make a movie cold thank you for smoking oh i saw that yeah um it it yeah um yeah it's crazy uh smoking barbecuing alongside just bad news it's not not good you know you're turning your lungs into smoke smoked beef and not great um so um yeah tylenol by the way also kills a lot of people yeah what is the number for tylenol over here um i'm not sure the exact number but i believe it until the opioid crisis i believe tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs um because wow basically it's uh if you have if you get drunk and take a lot of tylenol um acetaminophen essentially it causes liver failure so sevilla would like get get wasted and then like have a headache and then pop a tonic tylenol gardens whoa yeah curtains is a funny word yeah you know so but nobody's like you know raging against tylenol yeah it's weird except acceptable deaths are weird and that's the real the slippery slope about this uh people shaming people for wanting to go back to work you know other people are gonna die well if you drive do you drive oh well you should stop driving because people die from driving so you know you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools because like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming so let's not swim anymore yeah what is the really dangerous we need to chop down all the coconuts coconuts kill 150 people every year yes cut down all the coconut trees we need those people yes it's at a certain point in time it's like we yeah we're vulnerable and we're also we we're also we have a finite existence no matter what we do nobody lives forever right um i mean the the the i mean i think you want to look at say deaths as like the but for this uh disease whatever they would have lived x number of years yeah you know so um you know if somebody dies when they're they're they're 20 and could live till 80 they they lost 60 years but if somebody dies when they're 80 and they might live until 81 they last one year yes so it's it's like how many life years were lost uh is is a probably you know the right metric to use i don't uh read my own comments but i do read other people's comments and i was reading this one little twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that kovid takes an average of 10 years off people's lives and we should appreciate those 10 years and then someone else said that's not true i'm sure it's not true yeah definitely it's the twitter but someone else said the average age of people who die from covid is older than the average age people die it's very let's say just say it's like it's it's about the same that's a beautiful way of looking at it i mean it's it's unfortunate it sucks but it sucks if grandpa dies of alzheimer's or emphysema or leukemia it sucks sure it sucks when someone you love dies yes but i i'm i mean actually if if this uh i think a lesson to be taken here that i think is quite important is that if um if you have you know your great grandparents and their their age and grandparents really be careful with uh with with uh you know any kind of flu or cold or something that that wouldn't is not dangerous to kids or young adults but is dangerous too to help the elderly is um if basically if your kids got a runny nose they should stay away from their grandparents no matter what it is it's it's uh the things that are where a young immune system is has no problem and an older one has has a problem yeah and um in fact a lot of the a lot of the deaths are just are literally it's tragic but they're they're intra family um it's the the the little little kid had it had a you know called or flew and give it to grandpa yeah yeah they have the family gathering and they don't know that this is a big deal but it's it's just important to remember when you get older your immune system is just not that strong and uh and and so just be be careful with your with with your you know loved ones or elderly and i think there is some true objective um understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system and i really think that that that information should be that should be distributed in a way a non-judgmental way but like look this is this is a way that we can all like this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones and maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and and people that are vulnerable you know vitamin c heat shock proteins all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system yeah um actually just um a thing that that is is is tough uh if like when you as you get older it's it's hard to be you pretend to put on weight you know i certainly that's happening with me you know like as the older i get i'm like damn it's harder to stay lean uh that's for sure um and and so actually being being overweight is is a big deal yeah just uh it's a fact uh well yeah the new york hospital said it was the number one factor for severe uh kovid symptoms was obesity that was number one factor it is that that's yes exactly but it's also we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people's feelings so yeah absolutely we don't want to bring up the fact that being fat's bad for you it's a judgment on your food's great yeah i do love food yeah and i mean i mean to be totally frank i mean speaking for myself i'd i'd rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life yeah you know yeah those moments of enjoying a great meal yeah and then even talking about they're valuable they're worth something yeah it's not we don't want to eat soylent green and live to be 160. tasty if it was great one of the best things about life it really is yeah it's an art form as well it's like fine food it's a it's a it's a it's a delicious sand castle it's temporary it doesn't last very long but there's something about it that's very pleasing yeah yeah um yeah i mean i i don't know what what advice to give like um maybe smaller have tasty food with smaller amounts of it yeah and i think regulated feeding windows really the way to go some sort of an intermittent fasting approach sure when i started doing that i i i i found myself to be quite a bit healthier when i've deviated from that i've gained weight so how what's what's uh 16 hours well 16 hours yeah so like at night or yeah yeah yeah so i get to a certain point and then i count out i usually uh hit the stopwatch on my phone and then i look at uh 15 hours and i'm like okay got an hour before i can eat yeah and so anything in between that is just water or coffee actually you know like um this may be a useful bit of advice for for people but uh eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep yeah um and it can actually cause uh it heartburn that you don't even know is happening and and that subtle heartburn uh affects your sleep because you're you're horizontal and your body's digesting so if you want to improve the quality of your sleep um and and um you know uh you know be healthier uh it's it's do not eat right before we go to sleep yeah it's like one of the worst things you could do i had some of the biggest mistakes i've ever met i've i've done that uh particularly after comedy shows i'm starving i'll come home and i'll eat and then i go to bed and i just feel like [\u00a0__\u00a0] and i wake up in the middle of the night it's gonna it's gonna crush your sleep and it's gonna it's gonna damage your uh pilot your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus and it's it's it's so in fact drinking and then going to sleep is that's one of the worst things you could yes um so uh just try to avoid drinking and and you know um small amounts of alcohol that evidence suggests it's not it doesn't have a negative effect i put in the same category as delicious food it kind of makes things a little more fun yeah yeah i like it i mean some of the people some of the people who have left the longest you know um there's a woman in france who i think maybe has the record or close to it and she had a glass of wine every day every day you know yeah small small amounts is fine um but um yeah this is like a i i learned this like quite late in life it's like just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep and your quality of life will your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot for sure this is a it's a big deal and i think not widely not widely known do you have time to exercise um a little bit um do you train or anything um i do although i haven't seen for a while but um yeah especially yeah from out like uh you know say we're working on starship or something in south texas and i'm just living in my i got a little little house there in bukuchika village um and i don't have much to do so we're like i'm working and i was like dude just lift some weights or something you know um maybe uh i i i like i don't some people love running i don't love running um but what do you like to do exercise wise um too totally frank i wouldn't exercise at all if i could but if if i i'd prefer not to exercise but if i'm going to exercise and you know lift some weights and um and then kind of run on the treadmill and maybe watch a show that you know if there's a compelling show that like pulls you in right right right yeah that's a good thing to do yeah watch a good movie or yeah yeah episode of black mirror or something like that that's great man don't watch black mirror before going to bed either well don't watch black mirror today it's too [\u00a0__\u00a0] accurate yeah exactly it's like wait this already happened in real life yeah they're too close it's too close well even didn't jamie did you say that the the guy who makes black mirror mics off uh yeah yeah he said he it's not a good time to start season six yeah he wants to hold off because reality he's nailed it is black mirror oh man it's like he's gonna have to like re reassess and and attack it from a different angle yeah you should try something that's fun to do that's not just like like learn a martial art or something like that i did martial arts when i was kid like did you would you um i did taekwondo i did karate uh kaika shrinkai all right cool and um judo um also you you really branched out yeah um so um and did brazilian jiu jitsu briefly did you yeah where i made in palo alto really yeah oh no [\u00a0__\u00a0] i was gonna suggest that that's a great thing for people like that's a thing about jiu jitsu if you look at it from the outside you think oh a bunch of meat heads strangling each other sure but they're some of the smartest people i know or jiu jitsu fiends because they they get they first of all they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense but then they realize that it's essentially like a language with your body like you're having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language and it's really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are sure the the more you'll succeed in these ventures that's really also an accurate analogy of what jiu jitsu is yeah i mean i kind of i mean probably like a lot of people uh for the the way uh early day uh the first mma fights and joyce gracie and he was like incredible and it was like just like technique yeah yeah it was like you know winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing it's just like oh this is cool it was what martial arts were supposed to be when we were as we were kids yeah when you saw bruce lee [\u00a0__\u00a0] up all these big giant guys like wow martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you right most of the time that's not real especially if they know martial arts too it's like oh no yes but in the ufc when hoist gracie off of his back was strangling dan severin with his legs he was like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah this guy's being pinned by this big giant wrestler and he wraps his legs around his neck and chokes him to the point the guy has to surrender yeah amazing yeah it was amazing i mean horse got beaten up pretty bad in some of those he did well he definitely had some rough fights but he won he won yeah he's a legend and but what it showed in i mean i'm a huge lover of jiu jitsu what it showed is that there is a method for uh for diffusing these situations with technique and and knowledge yeah and i think it's also a great way to exercise too because it's almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing the the exercises like you want like and you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing and the analogy that i use is like if you imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort sure that's really what it's like yeah totally yeah when am i going to have my my kids i should say i sent my kids to uh jiu jitsu uh since they were like i don't know six oh really yeah oh that's awesome yeah it's it's a great thing to learn it really is seems like a good yes yeah maybe something like i mean even if you just have someone who hits that holds the pads for you like you get a workout in and to be fun um when am i going to be able to buy one of them roadsters when's that happening well i can't you know say exactly when but uh we got to get you know those this cover thing's kind of throwing us for a loop i'm sure um so um not to blame everything in the code but um it's you know certainly set us back on on progress for you know some number of months um the i mean things we've got to get get done uh ahead of roadster are um you know ramping up model y production um that'll be a great great car it is a great car getting the berlin gigafactory built and and also building y getting expanding the shanghai factory which is going great and um get the you know there's a cyber truck semi truck roadster um roaster is kind of like dessert so like we we gotta get the you know eating potatoes and greens and stuff you know like but roaster comes before cyber truck i mean i think we should do cyber truck first before before road before started interesting i'm not mad at that some other things for roadster uh they're they're you know the tri-motor uh plaid powertrain we're gonna have that in model s uh so that's like part one of the ingredients that's needed for for roadsters the the plaid powertrain the more advanced bat you know battery vacuum kind of thing i wanted to ask you about this before i forgot what there's a company that's called apex is taking your teslas and they're giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension sure how do you feel about that are you guys do you work with them are you cool with those people yeah i mean just i'm off yeah go ahead they're jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices you're cool with you can't [\u00a0__\u00a0] with that you don't have time so is it good that someone comes along and has a sort of specialty operation yeah i got no problem that's what it's called right it's like jmg is it called apex yeah i gotta unplug performance as apex that's right unplug performance yeah yeah you could for sure um you know lighten the car up and uh improve to tire traction and have you seen that company's stuff what they do i don't know specifically but there's it's pretty dope yeah they make a pretty dope looking they take model s and they they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber that's it right there that looks pretty nice yeah it does now the the plaid version of the model s you are you going to widen the track and doing a bunch do a bunch of different i know you guys are testing at the nurburgring can you not talk about that well i think we got to leave that for you know proper sort of product unveil i understand yeah i understand um last time you were here you convinced me to buy a tesla i bought it and it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] insane oh great glad you like it um i don't it's not just pretty fun it's like i the way i've described it is it makes other cars seem stupid they just seem dumb like i love dumb things i love dumb cars like i love campfires yeah i love campfires i have a 1993 porsche that's air-cooled sure it's like re it's not that fast it's really slow compared to the tesla yeah really so it's really quite slow yeah but there's something engaging about the mechanical this is like the the gears and it's very it's very analog but it's so stupid in comparison to the tesla like when i want to go somewhere in the model s i hit the gas and just goes yeah it just it like violates time yeah yeah um yeah you've tried it like ludicrous plus and stuff yeah yeah cool oh yeah we did just did a software update where it'll do it like a cheetah stance so uh yeah so it's it because it's got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back oh jesus yeah just like uh like a sprinter basically right like what do you do if you're a sprinter you're going to hunker down and then uh so i shaved like a 10th of a second off zero six i mean like you know it is pretty fun it's so i've taken so many people and i'm like i take them for the holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] moment i'm like you ready like hang on there and then a stomp on the gas i've never felt anything like it it's confusing yeah it really is the the instant torque the instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling it's baffling it's baffling they've never felt it no it's faster than falling it's crazy it's so fast it's a roller coaster yeah and my family yells at me when i stomp the gas like um i tell my kids i'm like you want to feel it you want to feel it like do it do it do it my wife's like don't do it yeah and even if i just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds that's pretty exciting yeah it's very it's like having a roller coaster on tap you know it really is like a roller coaster on top yeah without the loopty loops but it's the the pinning to your seat it seems like you're not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a can you know a consumer vehicle that you can just a regular person could buy if you have the money it seems too too crazy and then the idea of this roadster is a half of a second faster than that yeah that's madness well if that roads with a roadster we're going to do some things that are kind of unfair so we're going to take some things from like you know from uh kind of like rock rocket world and put them on the car so oh i read about that explain that like what do you do well like i said we can't oh the product unveiled right here but but it's gonna do some things that aren't fair and then the the when we do the unveil of the roadster let me just say that anyone who's been waiting they won't be sorry it's they won't be sorry oh i'm sure well anything that goes zero to sixty what is it one point nine is that the zero 0-60 that's the base model that's good what's the top of the food chain model okay okay faster than that let's just say faster yeah that seems so crazy to me now what was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window and they were supposed to not break and it broke well yeah i mean i know any circumstances are you know you know that our demos are authentic [Laughter] so i was not expecting that and i and then i think i muttered under my breath you didn't get mad though no you didn't steve jobs it um no i i i definitely swore uh but you know i didn't think the mic would pick it up but it did um and uh but so like we practiced this you know behind the scenes yeah i would like it tesla we don't do we don't do like tons of practice for for our demos because we we work we're working on the cars like we you know we're building new technologies and and improving the the fundamental products so we're not spending it like doing like hundreds of you know practice things or anything like that we don't have time for that um but the the just hours before the demo um both franz uh you know uh is a head of design and and i were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window and it's bouncing right off um and like okay this seems pretty good seems like we got it okay um and then we think what happened was that um when we when when franz hit the the the door with the sledgehammer you know sure like like this is this is like yeah yeah yeah exoskeleton you know high strength hardened steel you can literally take wind up with a sledgehammer you know full double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there's not even a dent it's cool but we think that that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then once you crack the corner of the glass that you just came over so uh then when you threw the bowl that that's what cracked the glass so it didn't go through though it didn't go through that's true that's true it didn't shatter the whole thing like a regular window would either which would just dissolve yeah right so in hindsight the ball should have been first sledgehammer second yeah yeah you live you learn yeah exactly listen man uh we've taken up a lot of your time you had a child yeah recently it's amazing that you had the time to come down here and i really appreciate that i appreciate everything you do man i i'm i'm glad you're out there and uh i really appreciate you coming down here and sharing your perspective well i think you got a great show thanks for having me on thank you my pleasure my pleasure elon musk ladies and gentlemen good night all right that should get a little i should get a little play that was great", "Episode Title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk", "Date": "2020-05-07T13:00:07Z", "URL": "www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8", "Guest": "Elon Musk"}, {"video_id": "efs3QRr8LWw", "text": "and okay you're very professional you know people are like how do you live and things like that they're taking money from the Russians and of course the answer's no but I I do this for a living like I speak I don't have a youtube channel that where it's you know I'm Joe Rogan but I give speeches at universities and things like that I do a lot of interviews and so we're recording now and set up ooh is it possible that you could do a YouTube channel would that work yeah like I I mean if you introduced me so like I get followers yeah we could do that too I'm all-in with that that could absolutely happen do you want to do that is it something you want to do no I mean this is a big question so I I came on because I just written a book called permanent record which is the the story of my life because that's what publishers make you do and when you're writing your first book but it's more than that because I didn't just want to talk about me it's actually about the changing of Technology and the changing of government in this sort of post 9/11 era which you know our generation just sort of happened to be growing up during and I was at the CIA and the NSA and all this stuff but the day that the book came out the government hit me with a lawsuit and they hit the publisher of the books with a with a lawsuit because they don't want to see books like this get written they especially don't want to see books like this get read and so the big thing was you know we didn't know where this was going we didn't know what was gonna happen and my publisher of course wanted me very badly to let people know this book existed in case the government leaned hard and harder harder we didn't know where where that's going I mean the government is still pursuing that case quite strongly they're more focused on though the financial censorship side of it basically taking any money that I made from it kind of is a warning to the others and getting a legal judgment against the publishers saying you know you can't pay this guy that kind of thing more so than taking the book off the shelves but that's not because they're okay with the book being on the shelves it's because thankfully we've got the first of and so they can't and that's a very rare and good thing but anyway in the context of that they were like well what about Joe Rogan and you know I I had heard about you at this point but you know the only thing that I had really seen that I really understood had familiarity with was like you talking to Bernie Sanders which by the way I very much appreciated hearing them because a lot of people don't give the guy time to talk yeah to hear him in those sound bites you don't really get an understanding of who he actually is right and this is the other thing like they're like well you know you can go on all these you know major Network shows and I I did a couple of them I did like a morning show I did Brian Williams but broadly the media the the the sort of more corporatized media as we might say is exactly what you just described right they they want you to be able to answer in like 8 15 seconds or less and when we're talking about big massive shifts in society we're talking about power we're talking about technology and how it controls and influences us in the future you you can't have a meaningful conversation with them those constraints and so it said these guys all want to say repeat these long discredited sort of criticisms and you know I'm sure you'll you'll you'll ask the same thing and that's ok they're there for questions but it's like we can't have the conversation if we can't have this space to think right breathe and have this sort of discussion so anyway they mentioned you and I was like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan Joe Rogan where do I know this name from before Bernie Sanders and I look back through my Twitter mentions and the funny thing is your fans have been harassing me to death for like the last year's wonderful people wonderful people but like go on Joe Rogan go on Joe Rogan and I remember like after I had just made a Twitter account Neil deGrasse Tyson actually I helped me get on Twitter gave me that little initial boost and they said Joe Rogan and so I they like linked you and you know I I mouse over your name cuz I use a desktop for this because security reasons and it pops up and I get your avatar man and like I have to say your logo it's the worst thing in the world for people who are like trying to be like politically serious and you know they're worried about the National Security Adviser condemning because like this bald guy with this maniacal grin and like the third eye on his forehead and I'm like oh man that's show but it's actually like you watch you know wouldn't when you watch what you do is it's great stuff man it's great but that first impression like I this almost didn't happen but everybody who has talked to you you know everybody who watches your show I think they get a very different impression and then how you're paying it and for me it's a wonderful thing because nobody understands that better than I do right like the government ran a smear campaign against me endlessly for six months when I came forward in June of 2013 I know we got way off topic here oh I'll get back to it fine there's no such thing as off topic we could do okay talk about whatever great great okay so for those people first off who have no idea who the hell I am I'm the guy who was behind the revelations of global mass surveillance in 2013 I worked for the CIA I worked for the NSA as a contractor at the NS a staff officer the CIA I was undercover working at embassies but and I talked about the difference between this and a book and contractor and government official and how it's all sort of lost its meaning but I saw something wrong and I saw basically the government was violating the law and what I believe to be the Constitution of the United States and more broadly human rights for everyone in the United States and around the world there were domestic surveillance programs there were mass surveillance programs that worked internationally basically everything that they could monitor led they were monitoring and this is actually like people go war isn't that obvious isn't that what they're supposed to do and this is weird but the answer actually is no under the framework of our Constitution the government is only supposed to be monitoring people that it has a individualized particularized suspicion of wrongdoing for right this is we think about this in the investing if means right like all those TV shows where they're like go and get a warrant the reason they have to do that like we fought a revolution over this you know a couple hundred years back is the idea that when we had you know Kings when we had governments of absolute power they could simply go in your home and go you know is this guy pot smoker get his diary you know whatever it is and just like if you find evidence of a crime you March them off to prison and it's all good you found evidence they're criminal or you didn't find evidence well no harm no foul you're just doing what government does we were trying to build a better system where when yes the government has extraordinary capabilities but it only uses them whether they're necessary right where they're proportionate to the threat that is presented by this person you know like we shouldn't be afraid of the person who's got like a baggie of weed in their dresser or something like that that is not a threat to national security that's not a threat to public safety but what happened in the wake of 9/11 was a whole bunch of government officials got together behind closed doors and this was actually led interestingly enough by the Vice President of the United States Cheney everybody remembers that name or hopefully I can look that name up Dick Cheney and his personal attorney sort of the the Giuliani of Dick Cheney a guy named David Addington and this lawyer David Addington wrote a secret legal interpretation but no one else was allowed to see it was kept in the vice president's safe at the White House they weren't giving this even when they told people and it was just a couple people in Congress Nancy Pelosi was one of them on a couple of these other folks when they talked to the heads of the agency the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and all this stuff they told them the White House in the office of legal counsel and you know this this the president's attorneys all of these guys had decided this would be legal to do but we can't tell you why we can't show you the legal authorization where you just got to take our word for it and so they did this and this became a mass surveillance program called stellar wind which they said was supposed to monitor the phone calls in Internet communications emails and things like that of everybody in the United States and around the world who they could get access to for links al Qaeda because if you remember in the wake of the September 11th attacks they were singing we thought there could be sleeper cells about Qaeda that we've just you know peppered all throughout the country they were gonna spring up at any moment of course like weapons of mass destruction it just didn't exist it was all the power grab but on that basis they started doing this in secret and it was completely unconstitutional was completely illegal even under the very loose requirements of the Patriot Act but they did it for so long that they got comfortable with it and they thought this is it you know this is a really powerful capability what have we started using this for stuff that was other than terrorism because it wasn't finding any terrorists because there weren't any terrorists in this context that we're looking for them and the ones who we're there were terrorists the program wasn't affected because these were guys in Pakistan that weren't using you know email and phone calls they were getting on you know moped with their cousin who was a courier who was bringing a letter to his guy you know who runs the the food stand or whatever but bit by bit over time this grew and grew and grew and there were scandals and if you want to drill down in these later all going to him but what happened was step by step by step our constitutional rights were changed and we weren't allowed to know it we were never granted a vote on it and even the many members of Congress right 535 in the United States they were prohibited from knowing this and instead they told only a few select people yeah in the original case there were only eight members of Congress called the gang of eight who knew about this then there were the people on the intelligence committees both in the Senate in the house who were told about this but they were only told partially about it they weren't told the full scope of it and now that they had been told about it because they had security clearances and like that they weren't allowed to tell anybody else even if they objected to it and we had one Senator Ron Wyden I mean another one I believe Tom Udall was named of him who did object to this and who wanted something to happen but because they couldn't tell anybody that was happening they were sort of doing these weird lassie barks to the press where they were like we have grave concerns about the way these programs are being carried out but nobody knew what they were talking about and so journalists were like you know they've got concerns what is that Lassie what are you trying to say timmy's them well but they were getting it wrong they couldn't tell what was happening so what had happened was that we the American people had sort of lost our seat at the table of government we were no longer partner to government we had simply become subject to government and I think everybody who's in the world today who is aware of what's going on whether it's under this administration last administration the one before that right they have seen a constant kind of shift where we have we the public have less say and less influence over the policy of government with each passing year there's kind of a new class that's being created a government class and then the public civil class that are held to different standards of behavior and when we start talking about leaking and whistleblowing this becomes even more clear and so what I did was I wanted to clarify that kind of lassie bark right I just wanted everybody to know what was going on I didn't want to say the government can't do this I didn't want to say this is how you guys have to live because that's not for me to say now but I do believe that everybody in the United States and more broadly people in the world who are having their rights violated by a government should have at least an understanding of how that is happening what the authorities sort of the policies and programs that are enabling that or so that they can protest them so that they can cast a vote about them so that they can't say you know what you guys say this is okay but I disagreed that this is not okay I object and I want things to change and so I gathered evidence of what I believe to be a criminal or unconstitutional activity on the part of government and I gave this to journalists right now I gave this to journalists under a very strict condition here which was that they publish no story in this archive of information simply because it was interesting right no clickbait not anything just because they thought it would make news that we get them awards they would only publish stories that they were willing to make an institutional judgment and stand behind and this was three different newspapers that it was in the public interest to know and so then beyond that there was additional is because if you could see sort of what I was doing here what had happened what had led us into this pitfall was that the system of checks and balances that's supposed to self-regulate our government had failed the courts had abdicated their role in policing the executive in the Congress because terrorism was such a hot argument at the time they were worried about being criticized and blamed if something went wrong an attack did go through and they didn't have access to the information that the programs were ineffective so they were just taking the government's word for it they didn't want to wait in Congress most of them didn't even know right and the ones who did know it was the same thing they were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors that were getting rich for building these systems that were violating the rights of each of us so they benefited by just saying nothing and then the executive themselves whether we're talking about Bush right whether we're talking about Obama or whether we're talking about Trump now all these guys were okay with a constantly growing surveillance state because they're the ones whose hands were on the lever at the time they got to aim it they got to use it if you had a little search box in front of you they would give you the email history and you know of everybody in the United States anybody you want if you could pull up their text messages anybody you want if you could see anything they've ever typed into that Google search box right Joe what is the worst thing you've ever typed into that search box that lasts forever right and they have a record of that they can get that from Google and so this was this was the whole thing how do we correct for that so when you have somebody who wants to inform the public of something and we'll get into the proper channels arguments later but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the institution knows it's wrong and is doing it anyway right that's the whole origin of the program is they want to do something that they're not allowed to do what do you do right and so I didn't want to say I'm the president of Secrets I didn't want to just put this stuff on the internet and I could have on the technologist right I worked with the journalists and then that to create an adversarial step right someone who would argue against what I believed and hopefully what the journalists believe once they consulted the documents and basically authenticated them can we get the government to play that role right and so before the journalists published any story this is a controversial thing people still criticize me for this actually they say I was too accommodating government think they could be right is that the journalist would go to the government and give them warning say we're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X Y & Z bad thing one is that right and the government always go over no comment right - is this gonna cause harm is anybody gonna get hurt is this program effective is there something we don't understand right as if something Snowden doesn't understand it is this guy just not get it right are these documents fake whatever you want say we shouldn't run this story in every case I'm aware of that process was followed and that's why right it was because there's a lot of people out there who don't like me who criticize me who go this was unsafe this caused harm to people or whatever we're in 2019 now I came forward and these stories weren't the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism starting way back in June of 2013 we've had six years to show bodies we've had six years to show harm and you know as well as I do the government's happy to leak things when it's in in their interest nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures because everyone who was involved in them was so careful we wanted to maximize the public benefit while mitigating the potential risks and I think we did a pretty good job but just to get back to the the main thing and the original thing that got us off on that trail when I came forward in June of 2013 and I gave one interview to the people who were in the room with the documents Laura Poitras Glenn Greenwald you and McCaskill and I said who I was I said why I was doing this I said what this was about why it matters and that we were constructing a system of turnkey tyranny and even if you trust that to Obama you never know whose hand is gonna be on that key next and all I have to do is turn it and there's nothing we can do to stop it the only thing that's restraining these programs really is is policy more so than the law and the President and anytime can sign a napkin and those policies change well after that I went six months without giving any interviews because I didn't want people to talk about me and I wanted them to talk about what actually mattered and the government of course was trying very hard to change the conversation as they always do to be about who is this guy what have they done right what's wrong with them what are their problems who is this this loony guy so they can controversial eyes the source of a story rather than having to confront that the story itself and that's why I said it's I I really kind of appreciate your your take on the media and everything like that because when you don't tell your story you know other people will tell it for you they'll say so many things about you and they'll have these misimpressions like I did because if something is stupid as the avatar that you were using on Twitter right well I think it's a certain kind of show with a certain kind of guy and it's this crazy stuff but when I actually listen to you when I actually look at the facts right and when I hear you just speak I go actually this is a thoughtful guy actually this is somebody who does care who does want to look at these things deeply and appearances and our first impressions can be very misleading I work hard on that I try to mislead people it's good works to my advantage do a good job man thank you I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA you started as a contractor right what was your initial impression and when did you know that things were really squirrely with the programs that sort of thing so I'm not saying this to put put you on the spot I know you've been a busy guy I don't know you hadn't done I think shows recently you come back from break right but have you read the book because it'll just help me your boyfriend if you haven't got a chance you know no I have not read your book or got a copy of it okay well I will send you a signed copy brother beautiful I don't hope you'll read it and I hope you enjoy it but alright so I had a really weird history in the intelligence community I grew up in a federal family in the shadow of Fort Meade right all these little suburban communities in Maryland where basically the entire industry of the state is the federal government of all these different agencies and then all the subcontractors all the defense industries that serve that government and really are kind of our war making a machine are our system of control for the country and the world broadly all that stuff spreads and you know a couple hundred mile radius out of DC my mother worked for the district courts rather than federal courts and it's kind of funny because she still works there and those are the courts that are trying to throw me in jail for the rest of my life now my father worked for the Coast Guard retired after 30 years my grandfather was an admiral and then he worked for the FBI as far back as it goes my my family my whole line of family even generations back was working for the government um so it was pretty ordinary pretty expected for me to go into the same kind of work now I started and I wasn't super successful in school because it I felt and you know this is the most arrogant thing in the world than anybody says that I had more to learn from computers than I did from you know biology class and so I spent more and more time focusing on technology then I got mono and I dropped out of high school and now it's like alright how do I make this up I drop out of high school but I'm actually going to Community College right they called it concurrent enrollment where I'm not taking any classes at high school I'm going to Community College instead and I'm not doing that great they're either like it's fine you know I'm enjoying it but you know school is school I I want I can't wait to be grown you're aboard um and I think a lot of people have felt that but I ran into somebody at the Community College who ran their own home-based business doing web design and they could see I was kind of technical and they went hey do you want to work for me and I was like the woman that sounds great and so I started doing web design really really early on this is like gosh I don't know probably a 1998 vintage during the big boom and then the collapse that followed and the funny thing is she worked she was married to an NSA analyst a linguist right and so she lived on Fort Meade and she ran her business out of their home on Fort Meade that's right up the street from the NSA so before I'm even working there I'm driving past this building all of the time and trying to figure out you know what the next step is gonna be and I enjoy this it's it's a good thing for me and it like it works well and I start getting trained and certified all these little industry stamps you've got to get as a technologist to say oh you know this program or whatever and just start climbing the ladder but then 9/11 happens and I'm on Fort Meade when 9/11 happens I'm just going into work and I tell this in the book in some detail and I think it's very much worth reading four people don't know this because this forgotten history but how old were you at this money uh uh OSH I was I was born at 83 so I was probably 18 years old and yeah yeah I just turned 18 a couple months before and what people forget is who knew what was going on before anybody else Wow on September 11th the intelligence community right and what did they do right did they give out a public warning did they tell you guys to evacuate did they say do this adder doesn't know no not for everybody not for a long time but at the NSA then director Michael Hayden he was a general he later became a director of the CIA ordered the entire campus evacuated of thousands tens of thousands of people actually just said go home right the CIA did the same thing they were running on skeleton crews at the moment the country needed them more than they ever had right and I get a call well not hear a call that's from my boss's wife her husband to her he's calling from the NSA he's saying hey you know I think edge leave for the day because I'm the only employee of this business besides her because I think they're gonna close the base down and I'm like this is crazy they've never closed us down we don't know what's happening then we start checking the news which is through websites right because we're we're doing all this stuff and suddenly it's the big story everywhere and you know nobody understands how big it is yet most of us are like oh it's gonna mess with our workday oh it's gonna mess with our commute but when I'm leaving I hear car horns all over the base it's the craziest thing because this is a military base right it's right outside the NSA and I entered just this absolute state of pandemonium as I go past k9 road which is the road that travels right and Pat it in front of the NSA's headquarters and it's just a parking lot as far as you can see they have military police out under the stoplights directing traffic because this is this mass evacuation and I still have no idea what's happening like the the story is still developing but I will never forget that image why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much authority that if at the moments we need them the most there are the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings and you know later on they said and this is uh covered in a book I believe I think it's James Bamford who interviewed that director of NSA who gave that order about what was happening he was going well you know he called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like that and then after that he wanted to think about well where could these other planes that they knew were in the air that it hadn't struck yet where could they be headed and this sort of shows how self centric the intelligence community is this is the DC metro area right they get hit the white house they get hit Congress they get hit the Supreme Court right I think oh they're gonna fly their planes into the CIA headquarters oh they're gonna fly their planes into the NSA headquarters and of course it was never realistic that these would be the targets but on that basis they were like oh let's get our bacon out of the pan but why say this I'm sorry but just in the interest of what wasn't it possible that they could have attacked those places I mean they attacked the Pentagon they you know they knew that there was attacked look it's it's absolutely possible they could have attacked your Denny's right you know but it's a question of risk assessment if you have planes in the air if you believe there's an ongoing terrorist attack that's happening in the United States right now and if you have built history's greatest surveillance agencies right that the most powerful intelligence forces in the history of the species you are gonna take those off the board or at least the majority of their personnel off the board then in a chance that you have no sort of grounds for substantiating that they could be targeting you to begin with simply because they could well somebody else will get hit with those as you say it's gonna be the Pentagon right it's gonna be the World Trade Center it's gonna be someone somewhere and the more minutes you're in front of that desk the higher the chances even if it's a very small chance even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism right maybe if it's somebody who normally works finance in North Korea right but they go look this is an emergency everybody understands you don't need to explain this you just go stop what you're doing look at financial transactions related to who purchased these plane tickets and do this you just go full spectrum and go anything you can do right now if the building gets hit we get hit that's what we signed up for nobody wants that right that that's not the desired outcome but if they had asked the staff to do then they all would have agreed that's what these people signed up to do and yet the director goes no you know we're just just know like we're not gonna take that writ and this is I think it says so much about the bureaucratic character of how government works right the people who rise to the top of these governments it's about risk management for them right it's about never being criticized for something and this is look if we want to get really controversial this is something that'll that'll haunt me because people will bring it up again and again and again people ask about you know people still criticize me in the book you know I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that effect there there's no evidence for that I went looking on the network right and III know Joey I know you want there to be aliens a doob I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly once there to be aliens and there probably are right but the idea that that we're hiding them if we are hiding them I had ridiculous access to the networks at the NSA the CIA the military all these groups I couldn't find anything right so if it's hidden and it could be hidden it's hidden really damn well even for people who are on the inside but the main thing is conspiracy theories right everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense it helps us believe that somebody has control in control right that somebody is calling the shots that these things all happen for a reason to stand the other there are real conspiracies but they're not typically you know they've got tens of thousands of people working on them unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself which is basically constructed on the idea that you can get I I think there's a four million or 1.4 million people in the United States who hold security clearances and you can get all of these people to not talk ever the journalists in this that or the other but when you look back at the 9/11 report and when you look back at the history of what actually happened what we can prove right not what we can speculate on but what are at least two commonly agreed facts not it's very clear to me as someone who worked in the intelligence community not during this period of course I was too young but very shortly thereafter that these attacks could have been prevented and in fact the government says this too but the government goes the the reason that they these attacks happen the reason that they weren't prevented is what they call stovepiping right there was there was not enough sharing they needed to break down the walls and the restrictions that were chaining these poor Patriots at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI from all working on the same team and to some extent they're they're correct on this right there there were limits on Way agencies were supposed to play ball with each other but I worked there and I know how much of this is and how much as this is not those are procedural and policy limits in some cases legal limits on what can be shared without following process without doing this that or the other without basically asking for permission without getting a sign-off or anything like that if the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had to the CIA they could have done so if the CIA wanted to send everything they had to the FBI they could have done so they didn't and people died as a result now government goes bureaucratic procedural ISM was responsible and it's because we had too many restrictions on the intelligence community and this is what led to the world post 9/11 where all of our rights sort of evaporated was they went well restrictions on what these agencies can do are costing lives therefore naturally we just have to unchain these guys and everything will be better right and if you remember that post 9/11 moment you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive how that might be a kind of thing to go you go all right well will that make sense because everybody was terrified right there were people quite quickly who got their heads back on their shoulders the right way there were some of them who never lost their heads at all and who protested the Iraq war at the same time lion-o himself was signing up to go fight it volunteering for the army and we're getting into that a minute but everything that has followed in the decades past came from the fact that in a moment of fear we lost our heads and we abandoned all the traditional constitutional restraints that we put on these agencies and we abandon all of the traditional political restraints and just social constraints ideological systems of belief about the limitations that the secret police should have in a free and open society and we went look you know terrorists we created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer where he's like threatening knife people's eyeballs out if they won't tell him this that the other and we entered this era of increasingly unlimited government as a result and now in hindsight we go we should have been surprised but at the time everyone everyone panicked trying but if you go back to you did that help and we know the answer now is in fact no it did not it made things worse I don't think any historian is gonna look at the Bush administration and go this improved the position of the United States in the world but if you go back you don't wind back the tape to that pre 9/11 moment lying back the tape to those silos and those walls that they said needed to come down because that was restraining government instead of the rules that said we can't share these things but there's got to be a basis there's got to be a justification you've got to go why are we trading people's information like baseball cards and all of this stuff it's super easy as an intelligence officer to justify sharing information about a suspected terrorist who you think is planning to kill people or is even just in a country they shouldn't be or a place they shouldn't be or doing something you don't think they should be with another agency because no one's gonna question that a judge isn't gonna question that any judge in the world will stamp that warrant without even thinking about it and go to bed that night you know without a care in the world because you're not spying on a journalist you know spying on a human rights defender right this is not an edge case now this is someone that you believe to be associated with al-qaeda or whatever now this is all a lot of preamble to say that essential fact government agrees everyone agrees the attacks probably could have been prevented if information had been shared so why wasn't the information shared government says information wasn't shared because of these restrictions and it's half true because every important lie has has some criminal truth to it and and there were these barriers but the reality is why were those barriers respected in the case of a major terrorist plot why wasn't the CIA sharing information with the FBI why wasn't the FBI sharing information with the NSA why was the Anastacia sharing information with the CIA in the case of Mary major terrorists and if you've worked in government if you've worked in the intelligence community if you worked in any large institution you know if you work at a company that sells batteries you know that every office is fighting the other office for budget for cloud for promotions and this is the sad reality of what actually happened every one of those agencies wanted to be the guy who busted the plot they wanted to be the one who got credit for it and they didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late because they were competing with each other rather than cooperating that's exactly what I was gonna ask you if that was the issue the competition between these agencies because they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something with the FBI accomplishing something and they they want to be the one to take credit for that yeah and I mean I think it's important like in their defense because nobody else here is gonna provide a defense for them is that that's actually darkly human again this happens in every industry this happens in every sort of big corporate thing because you want to get promoted and you know everybody's putting in their like achievements at the end of the year for what they did if you're the guy who does that you're going straight to the top but their solutions status was the the so we we have a weird delay here for folks that are listening claim their solution instead of having someone be responsible for bridging the gap and providing that information to each individual agency their solution was mass surveillance well no they're they're different things this is 9/11 is what woke these guys up ROM basically and they went well we screwed up and Americans died as a result we really don't want to take the hit on that and to be honest the government had no interest in putting the hit on them to be honest the public had no interest in putting the hit on them at the time because everybody understood terrorism is a real thing there are bad people in the world and that's true right that will always be true there's always going to be criminals there's always going to be terrorists whether they're at your Church whether they're across the ocean there are people out there who are angry they're disenfranchised they're violent and they just want to harm something they want to change something even in a negative way because that's what they feel is all they have left which these are criminals right these are people that we don't need to pity but if we ever want to stop it we do need to understand it and where those things come from where there's there's drives come from in the first place but basically everybody went alright how do we stop this because nobody wants to feel unsafe nobody wants to feel like the building's gonna come down then the next time you go in it and so everybody just went I don't care who does it stop it and they said this to Dick Cheney which is a historic mistake but cuz date Dick Cheney knows how government works he was the person in that White House who was best placed to know all the levers of government all the interagency cooperation where we were strong where were weak what we could do what we were not allowed to do and what he did was he took that little dial on what we're not allowed to do and he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off and then there was nothing that we couldn't do anymore and you were in there why this was happening this was this no I was I was not again this is 2001 I was I was 18 years old I was working on the base I had drove past the building but that was it this is all hindsight this is biography this is documented history but this is not you know the Gospel of Edward Snowden I I don't know this right this is public record this is Ken what we all know what we have though the the reason that I bring this up is this is a teachable moment because there's so many people right now in the Trump administration who go look this guy has too much power he's abusing it against immigrants he's abusing it against domestic ponents he's doing whatever he's trying to hurt political rivals in the next election all of this stuff and you know we can get into this stuff later if you want in detail but the bottom line is they're going this is a guy who's in the White House is throwing elbows right he doesn't really care he wants to hurt people as long as he can convince the Americans that those are the bad guys right that's the enemy doesn't matter if they're far away it doesn't matter if they're close at home whoever he's against he's gonna harm and the dark thing is this is actually why he was elected in moments of fear where the world starts falling apart and this happens in a thornton country after country this is why you have Vladimir Putin in Russia who's been there for 20 years right president for basically 20 years think about that you know he sort of skipped in the middle there because he had to dodge the fact that presidents can only serve so many consecutive terms so he dropped down a prime minister and then came back as president but think about that how do you get that kind of political longevity and it's because if you know anything about Russian history which you know I even I don't know that much about it the 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union we're an extraordinarily dark time if you look at Russian cinema all they had or gangster movies right all they had were the disintegration of society how things are dark and broken no one trusts each other pensions were no longer being paid Social Security's not there anymore like there's nothing to buy there's nothing to do there's no job no one had a future and so they went if there's somebody who can lead us out of this if there's somebody who will fix this who will find us an enemy and defeat that enemy to restore prosperity we'll put them in office we see it happen in Turkey with Iran right we've seen it happen successively with bad governments even in Western democracies we see it happening sadly in places like Poland and Hungary you can even argue it's happening in the United Kingdom right and now there are a lot of people arguing that sisk exactly what we're seeing with Donald Trump's White House in the United States and this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001 is when we become fearful we become vulnerable right to anyone who promises they will make things better even if they have no ability to make things better even if they will actively things worse even if they will make things better for themselves and their buddies by taking from you but if they tell you that they'll make things better and you believe them in a moment of fear that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes so sorry let me let me turn this back over to you because we got way off track there no that's all right I want to bring it back to the initial question so you're working for the NSA when do you realize there's a huge issue and when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about this issue like when when do you contact these journalists and what was the thought process regarding this like what what steps did you go through once you realize that this was in violation of the Constitution and that even with the laws of the Patriot Act in the Patriot Act two things had changed so radically that you knew this was wrong and you had to do something about it you felt a responsibility to speak out okay so since we gave so much historical preamble let me just give the the Cliff Notes version okay to get us up to that so after September 11th I'm a little bit lost I'm doing my technical stuff but it doesn't really feel like it matters anymore like I'm making more money I'm becoming more accomplished but the world's on fire right if you remember there was a crazy mood of patriotism in the country because we were all trying to come together get through it you remember like people were sticking Dixie Cups on the top of every chain-link fence on every overpass that was like stand together you know never forget mm-hmm united we stand flags on every car exactly and you know I was a young young guy who is not especially political right and I come from a military background federal family all that stuff and so that means I'm very vulnerable to this kind of stuff I see it on the news and Bush and all his sort of cronies are going look it's al Qaeda it's terrorism terrorist organization they have all these international connections there's Iraq you know dictators weapons of mass destruction they're holding the world at ransom you got Colin Powell at the UN dangling little vials of like fake anthrax and so I felt an obligation to do my part and so I've volunteered to join the army yeah you you probably can't tell from from looking at me but I'm not gonna be at the top of the MMA circuit anytime soon so it didn't work out I joined a special program that was called the 18 X ray program where they take you in off the street and they actually give you a shot at becoming a Special Forces soldier so you train harder and special platoons you go further and I ended up breaking my legs basically so they put me out of your legs discharged yeah it was basically what it was when they were shin splints that I was too dumb to get off of right so I kept marching under wait I'm a pretty light guy to begin with I had a 24 inch waist when I when I joined the army girls are jealous my way yeah I think I weighed like a hundred and twenty-eight pounds III got I was in great shape you know in boot camp because I came up really quick because it was a you know all I could do was gain but it was it was just too much on my frame because I wasn't that that active and so when you keep running on a stress injury right and you're running under weight with like rucksacks and things like that you're running in like boots and then you're doing exercises and the Army's like a whole chapter in the book you you got your battle buddy right because they never allow you to be alone I was gonna have somebody watching you they thought it was funny to put me the smallest guy in the platoon that the drill sergeants did with the biggest dude in the platoon it was like an amateur bodybuilders like you know 230 260 something like that he's a big fellow and so you know he would uh when we're off in the woods doing these these marches and things like that we have to practice but he carries like the fireman's carry and things like that he throws me around his neck you know I'm like a towel he's just skipping down like it's nothing and then I gotta put him on me and I'm just like oh god die and it was it was it was weirdly fun I I enjoyed it but it was no good for my body and so in a land navigation movement I step off a log because I was on point and on the other side of the log because it's the woods in Georgia I'm at Sand Hill I see a snake and so in my memory you know it's like time slows down because North Carolina you know where I grew up you think all snakes are poisonous sorry there's an issue we know we're good it's completely fine no we're fine I just there was something that happened on the screen I wanted to make sure it was okay no that's just so by joining the chat that's what I was worried about ii opened up here yeah so anyway I try to take a much longer step in midair I land badly and it's it's just one leg is like fire I'm limping I'm limping and whipping but you know everybody says don't go to sick call cuz you go to sick call you lose your slot you'll end up general infantry our regular infantry and so I go back I just tough it out I get my rack in the next morning when I get out of the rack which is the the top bunk bed right I jump down in my legs they just give out underneath me and I try to get up in and I just can't get up and so I got a sick call and I end up going to the hospital and they end up x-ray and me and they also x-rayed my battle buddy because I gotta go there was somebody else and he has a broken hip where they had to bring him to surgery and it's in the book there's a lot more detail about it was kind of a dramatic moment but for me they just said I had bilateral tibial fractures right all the way up my legs they said I had spiderwebs and the next phase of the training was jump school right where you gotta jump out of a plane and the doctor you know I was like son if you jump on those legs they're gonna turn into powder and he's like I can hold you back you know we can put you for like six months you stay off them then you can go back through through the whole cycle right start basic from scratch but you'll lose your slot in the special forces pipeline because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that and then you'll basically be reassigned to the needs of the army or which probably meant I was going back to IT which was what I joined the army kind of escape or you can go out on this special kind of discharge that's called an administrative discharge right normally got honorable discharge dishonorable discharge things like that this is something for people who have been in for I think less than six months where it's like a mulling a marriage it's as if it never happened is is if you never joined and at the time I was like well you know that's very kind of him to do that and I took it you know they they dissent me to sit call or sorry the sickbay where you're in like the medical platoon and you do nothing for I think about a month and then then they let you out once the paperwork all finishes but in hindsight I realized that if you take it administrative discharge it exempts the army for liability for your injuries so actually what I thought was a kindness was just you know now if I had future problems with my legs they wouldn't have to cover it or health insurance on any of those things anyways it was just a funny thing but anyway I get out of the army and here I'm on crutches for a long time and just sort of trying to figure out all right well what's next in life because I had gotten basic security clearance just for going through signing up for the military process I applied for a security guard position at the University of Maryland because it said you had to get a top-secret clearance which was with a higher clearance than I had at time and I went well that sounds good because I knew if I combine my IT skills which were now suddenly much more relevant again to my future with the top-secret security clearance because of the way it works if you have a top-secret security clearance and tech skills you get paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work so I was like alright well you know I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector working for government at this level at this phase because what we talked about earlier with September 11th and how the intelligence community change they no longer cared that I hadn't graduated from college right and I had gotten GED just by going in and taking a test so for government purposes it was the same as if I was a high school graduate so now suddenly it was like these these doors are open now this University of Maryland facility turned out to be an NSA facility it was called a castle the center for the Advanced Study of language at the University of Maryland College Park and all I was was literally a security guy walking around with with a walkie-talkie making sure nobody breaks in at night managing the electronic alarm system and things like that but once I had my foot in the door there I could start climbing ladder step by step and I applied for or I went to a job fair actually that was only for people who had security clearances and I ended up going to the table for one of the technical companies it was a little tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard of and they said you know we've got tons of positions for somebody like you are you comfortable working nights and I was like yeah you know I wake up in the middle of day anyway that that's fine with me and suddenly I've gone from working for the NSA through a university in a weird way where it's like the NSA holds the clearance but I'm formerly an employee of the state of Maryland at the the college and this is government man it's all these weird dodges and boondoggles for how people are employed there now suddenly I'm working at CIA headquarters right the place where all the movies show you swoop over the marble seal and everything like that I'm the king of the castle right I'm there at the middle of the night when no one else is there the lights are on motion sensors it's the creepiest thing in the world there's like flags on the wall that are just like gently billowing in the air-conditioning like ghosts the hallway lights up as you walk alongside it because it's like a green building and they disappear behind you and there's there's no one there I can go down to the gym at like 2:00 o'clock in the morning at the CIA and it's like not see a soul on the other side of the building then go all the way back and this kind of thing was was my end because they were like look it's the nightshift nothing that bad is gonna happen um but it was on a very senior technical team that was basically handling systems administration for everybody in the Washington Metropolitan Area right so every basically CIA server this is a computer system that like data is stored on the reporting is stored on that traffic is moved on all of this stuff suddenly me this is a circa 2005 I think I'm in charge of and it's just me and one other guy on the night shift and if you're interested in the book there's a lot of detail on this but I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually know a lot about technology they were expecting me just to basically make sure the building doesn't burn down all these systems don't go down overnight and then never come back up but they go well are you willing to go overseas and to a young man at that age that's actually like hey that sounds kind of exciting you know who doesn't want to go work overseas for the CIA and there's a lot of people listening the podcast who are like oh not me wait the CIA's the bad guys right yeah exactly they're like what are you gonna go overthrow a government somewhere but you have to understand that I'm still very much a true believer the government is like the living compressed embodiment of truth and goodness and light you know the shining city on the hill so I want to do my part to spread that to the world I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here and so I sign up and I go through this special training school like people hear in movies about the farm which is down at Camp Peary in Virginia I'm sent that's actually much more secret facility called the hill which is in Warrenton Virginia and this is been covered a few times and open-source media but I think this is one of the few book length discussions of what happens there in permanent record but yeah so I go through training and then I get assigned overseas and I end up in Geneva Switzerland undercover as a diplomat right I think I'm my formal title for the embassy is like something super playing like diplomatic attache and what I am is I'm a forward deployed tech guy they send you through this school to make you into kind of a MacGyver right yes you can handle all the computers but you can also handle the connections for the Embassy's Power Systems right the actual electrical connections you can handle the HVAC systems right you can handle locks and alarms and security systems basically anything that's got an on button on it at the Embassy that's secure now you're responsible for and I traveled from Geneva to other countries in Europe for sort of assignments and it was like it was an exciting time I actually still enjoyed it but this was where I first working with intelligence started to get doubts and the story's been told many times so I won't go over in full detail here but the CIA does primarily and it's not the only thing they do what's called human intelligence now there are many different types of intelligence than the intelligence community is responsible for the primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence you want to think of signals intelligence right as tapping lines hacking computers all of these sort of things that provide electronic information anything that's digital or analog signal that can be intercepted then turned into information human intelligence is you know all that fun stuff we've heard the CI for decades and decades which is where they try to turn people basically they say look we'll give you money if you sell out your country they don't it's not even your country a lot of times it's your like organization these guys could be working for a telecommunications provider and they want to sell customer records over they worked at a bank which was the thing that I saw and we wanted records on the banks customers so he wanted a guy on the inside but anyway that that's sort of how it works and what I saw was they were way more aggressive for the lowest stakes than was reasonable or responsible they were totally willing to destroy somebody's life just on the off chance they would get some information that would that wouldn't even be a tremendously valuable and so you know ethically thatthat struck me as a bit off but I let it pass because what I what I've learned over my life short though it's it's been you know it's that skepticism is something that needs to build up over time it's a skill something that needs to be practiced or you can think of it as something that you developed through exposure I kind of like a radiation poisoning but in a positive way it's when you start to realize inconsistencies or hypocrisy that Ward lies and you notice them and you know you you give somebody the benefit of the doubt or you trust them or you think it's all right but then over time you see it's not an isolated instance it's a pattern behavior and over time that exposure to inconsistency builds and builds and builds until it's something that you can no longer ignore now after the CIA I went to the NSA in Japan where I was working there in Tokyo and then from there a couple years later I went to the CIA again now I was working as a private employee for Dell but I was the senior technical official on Dells Sales Account the CIA you know people these big companies they have say accounts to the CIA and so this means I'm going in and now it's crazy because I'm still a very young man but I'm sitting across the table from Chiefs of these enormous CIA divisions I'm sitting across from their chief technology officer for the entire agency or the chief intelligent her chief information officer for the entire CIA and these guys are going look here's a problems here's what we want to do and it's my job to pitch them a system right and I've got paired up with this sales guy and the whole thing is just go how much money can we get out of the government right that's the whole goal and we'll build them what we were pitching was a private cloud system right everybody knows about cloud computing now it's like why your Gmail account is available wherever you go it's why Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere the government wanted to have these kind of capabilities to Dell ended up getting beat out by Amazon people well you know some people aren't familiar with this many of them are but Amazon runs a secret cloud system for the government I forget what they've rebranded it now but this is just there's this massive connection between industry and government in the classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper but at this point I I was already I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government but I was just trying to get by I was trying to ignore the conflicts I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies and I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions not just in our country but around the world I struggle with every day right there they got a job they got a family they got bills that they're just trying to get by and they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things they know some of the things they're doing are actively wrong but they know what happens to people who rock the boat eventually I changed my mind and when I had gone to Hawaii which was the final position in my career with the intelligence community I was because of an accident of history here I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all I was supposed to be at a group called the national threat Operations Center and talk but because of the way contracting works and again this is covered in the book I end up being reassigned to this little rinky-dink office that nobody's ever heard of in the light called the Office of information sharing and I'm replacing this old-timer who's about to retire a really really nice guy but he spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and letting people be content to the fact there are letting people forget that his office existed because he was the only one in it there's there's a manager who's like over him but it's actually over a larger group and he just looks over him as sort of a favor so now I come in and now I'm the sole employee of the office of information sharing but I'm not close enough to retirement that I'm ok with just doing nothing at all so I get in business and I come up with this idea for a new system called the heartbeat and what the heartbeat is gonna do is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence community both at the NSA and across Network boundaries which you normally can't cross but because I've worked at both the CIA and the NSA I knew the network well enough both sides of it sides that normal workers at the NSA would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other I could actually connect these together I could build bridges across this kind of network space and then draw all of these or records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID basically your your sort of ID card that says this is who I am I work for this agency I work in this office these are my assignments these are my group affiliations and because of that the system would be able to eventually aggregate records that were relevant to your job that were related to you and then it could provide them and basically you could hit this site it would be an update of what we used to call read boards which were manually created there we go look you work in network defense right these are all the things that are happening on a network defense you work on I don't know economic takeovers in Guatemala you know if this is what's going on for you there but in my off time I helped the team that sat next to me which was a systems administration team for a for Windows Networks because I had been microsoft certified systems engineer' which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks and this was all those guys did and they always had way too much work way too much work and I had basically no work that I needed to do at all because all I was supposed to do was share information which was not something that was particularly in demand because most people already knew what they wanted her what they needed so it was basically my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious and so I did some side gigs for these other guys and one of them was running what were called dirty word searches now dirty word searches are let me let me dial this back because I know we're sort of this is hard to track everything that the NSA does in large part is classified everything the CIA does in large part is classified if I made lunch plans with other people in my office it was classified that was the policy it's dumb they this over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now this is the reason we don't understand what they're doing this is why they can get on wrong way this is why they can get away with breaking the law or violating our rights for so long you know five years ten years fifteen fifty years before they see before we see what they were doing and it's because of this routine classification right but every system computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it and we've got all these complicated systems for code words and caveats that establish a system of what's called compartment ation and this is the idea when you work at the CIA when you work at the NSA you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you right because you don't have need-to-know right again that thing from the movies and the reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything Ryan tell everybody everything they don't want anybody to know too much particularly when they're doing lots of bad things because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's passed the point that we can justify and they might develop sort of an ideological objection to that well in the office of information sharing and actually in basically every part of my career before that I had access to everything I had what was called a special caveat on my accesses called protec which means privileged access what this means you're kind of super user you know most people have all of these controls and the kind of information that can access but I'm in charge of the system right people who need information they have to get it from somewhere they don't know even the director of the CIA right he says I need to know everything about this well he doesn't know where to get it he's just a manager somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds and get those things that guy was me and so dirty word searches were these kind of automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartment ation and exceptionally controlled information that's kind of you could think of it as above top secret in these special compartments right where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for you only know the code word unless you work in them unless you have access to them unless you read into them one day I get a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never heard of called stellar wind it came back because the the little caveat for they're called handling caveats which is like you know you can think of like Burn After Reading or for your eyes only but this one's called STL W which means stellar wind unless you know what stellar wind is you don't know how to handle it all I knew is it wasn't supposed to be on my system you know this is a little bit unusual and it turned out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii and this person was a lawyer I believe and they had worked in the inspector general's office and they had compiled a report part of the inspector general's report which is when the government is investigating itself into the operations and activities of this program well this was the domestic mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation that started under the Bush White House stellar wind was no longer supposed to be really an operation it had been unveiled in a big scandal in December 2005 in the New York Times by journalist James risin and I I'm not gonna name him because I don't want to get it wrong another journalist you can look at the byline now if you want to see their involvement but and there's there's a lot of history here too but um what they had found was of course the Bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program if you remember the warrantless wiretapping scandal that was affecting everyone in the United States well the Bush White House was really put in a difficult position by this scandal they would have lost the election over this scandal because the New York Times actually had this story in October 2004 which was the election year they were they were ready to go with it but at this specific request of the White House talking to the publisher of the New York Times Saul's burger and Bill Keller than the executive editor of the New York Times the New York Times said we won't run the story because the president just said if you run this story a month before the election that's very tight margin if you recall you'll have blood on your hands and it was so close to 2001 the New York Times just went you know what fine Americans don't need to know that the kind of sushis big violator they don't need to know that the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what they think it means if the government says it's alright and it's a secret you shouldn't know about it that's fine now December 2005 why did that change why did the New York Times has suddenly run this story well it's because James Rison the reporter who found this story had written a book and he was about to publish this book and the New York Times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got scooped by their own journalists and so they finally did it but it was too late Bush had been reelected and now he was sweeping up the broken glass of our lost rights so Congress the bush White House was very effective and as I said before telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed and they told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to but made them culpable for hiding the existence from the program the existence of the program from the American people and this is why someone like Nancy Pelosi who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy-buddy with George Bush was completely okay in defending this kind of program in fact and you know later she said oh well she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter the White House but she never showed us the letter she went on well that was that was classified right and this is not to bag on her individually it's just she's a great example in here an unnamed example everyone knows of how this process works the White House will implicate certain very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity and so on when then when the White House gets in trouble for it the Congress has to run cover for the White House and so what happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the protect America Act now which should have been our first indication this is a very bad thing because they never named a law something like that unless something terrible and what it did was it retroactively Lee immunized all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day by handing your records over to the government which they weren't allowed to do simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying please do this and these companies went look now that we've been uncovered now that we've been shown that we're breaking or now that these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights of Americans and a staggering scale that could bankrupt our companies because we can be sued for this we will no longer cooperate with you unless you pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this and so we get the Patek tamerica Act which stays you know as an emergency yeah this is all public history - yeah you can look this up on Wikipedia you know and so then they they go it's an emergency law we have to pass this now we have to keep this program active Bush is going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continue it under this new authority where it's gonna have some special level of oversight and these kind of things eventually but for now we just have to make sure people are safe again they go to fear they say if we don't have this program terrorist attacks will continue you know people will die blood on your hands blood on your hands blundering hands think of the children protect America Act passes the companies get off the hook the Bush White House gets off the hook the Congress that was then sharing in criminal culpability for authorizing or rather letting these things go by without stopping them then passes in 2008 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008 this is called the the FAA 5-minutes Act of 2008 and rather than stopping all of the unlawful and sort of unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal hubs for them to jump through now this is not to say you know these things aren't helpful at all it's not say they're not useful at all but it's important to understand when the government's response to any scandal then this applies to any country is not to make the activities of the person who is caught breaking the law comply with the law but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law legal right they make the law comply with what the agencies want to do rather than making the agencies comply with law that's a problem and that's what happened here now the intelligence community's powers actually grew in response to this scandal in 2008 because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this over with there were objections there were people who knew this was a bad idea but it didn't passed on now what the public took away from this because a part of these laws was a requirement that the Inspector General of all of these different intelligence community elements and the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program this is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law and basically look back at how this program was constituted what it did what the impacts and effects were and that was supposed to be sort of the Truth and Reconciliation Council right now why am I talking about all this ancient history well I'm sitting here in 2012 with a classified Inspector General's report draft report from the NSA that names names that says Dick Cheney it says David Addington this is Nancy Pelosi that says all these people who are involved in the program the tick-tock of how it happens it says the director of the NSA that guy who is evacuating the building at the beginning of our our our podcast here that guy was asked by the President of the United States if he would continue this program after being told by the White House and the Department of Justice that these programs were not lawful that they were not constitutional and the president said would you continue this program on my say-so alone knowing that it's risky knowing that it's unlawful and he said yes sir I will if you think that's what's necessary to keep the country safe and at that moment I realize these guys don't care about the law these guys don't care about the Constitution these guys don't care about the American people they care about the continuity of government they care about the state right and this is something that people have lost we hear this phrase over and over again national security national security national security and we're meant to interpret that to mean public safety but national security is a very different thing from public safety national security is a thing that in previous generations we referred to as state security national security was a kind of term that came out of the Bush administration to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new kind of secret police across the country and what does it mean when again in a democracy in the United States the public is not partner to government the public does not hold the leash of government anymore but we are subject to government right we are subordinate to government and we're not even allowed to know that it happened no not in in the book I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan and what's interesting is the unclassified version of a report and we've all seen this today with things like the Muller report and all of the intelligence reporting that's happened in the last several years when the government provides a classified report to the public it's normally the same document the unclassified version the classified version are the same thing just the unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say oh you're not allowed to know this sentence for this paragraph or this page or whatever the document that the public had been given about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document it was a document tailor-made to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States and it was effective in doing that and in 2012 what I realized was this is what real-world conspiracies look like right it doesn't have to be smoking men behind closed doors right it's lawyers and politicians it's ordinary people from the working level to the management level who go if we don't explain this in a certain way we're all gonna lose our jobs or the other way they go we're gonna get something out of this if we all work together civilization is the history of conspiracy right what what is civilization but a conspiracy for all all of us to do better by working together right but it's this kind of thing that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell I want all your listeners right to go to the Washington Post because this document that I discovered that that really changed me has been published courtesy of The Washington Post it's called the the inspector general's report on on stellar wind and you can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted right I had no blacked-out pages on mine and what I believe it shows is that some of the most senior officials in the United States elected and unelected worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded powers now in their defense they said they were seeking these powers for a good and just and noble cause right they say they were trying to keep us safe but that's what they always say that's what every government says that's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian government says and the question is if they are truly keeping us safe why wouldn't they simply just tell us that well why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress why wouldn't they put that to a vote because if they were and they could convince us that they were they'd win the vote and particularly we all know like the Patriot Act passed more the worst pieces of legislation in modern history passed why didn't we get a vote and I think if you read the report the answer we clear so I'm sorry Joe I went on for various no is amazing it's act don't don't apologize at all it's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion that is so well it's it's much it's much more much more but right right literally the president at the heart of it yes at the heart of it in every expression of executive power right and by executive we mean the White House here the CIA the NSA the FBI the DOJ right beat these guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government in a real way they work for the White House now there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say they're supposed to do this and they're supposed to say they're not supposed to do that but when you look at federal regulations when you look at policies as an employee of government when you violate these policies the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job because there's no criminal penalty for the violation of these laws and so it's very easy for people who exist in these structures particularly the very top levels of these structures to go look we have a given set of lawful authorities and these are defined very broadly to give us leeway to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate and just now take that proper inappropriate and just from the perspective of any given individual Ryan any given president now intersect that with what's good for them politically and that's where problems begin to arise now the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this in the u.s. system in a democracy broadly is these people are supposed to be what are called public officials that means we know their decisions that means we know their policies that means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers like what they are doing both in our name and what they're doing against us and because they are transparent to us we the people can then police their activities we can go and disagree with this we can protest it we can't campaign against and write we can try to become the president do whatever they are public officials and we are private citizens they're not supposed to know anything about us right because we in relative terms hold no power and they hold all the power so they have to be under the tightest constraints we need to be in the freest circumstances and yet the rise of the state-secrets doctrine right this whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century about the middle of the last century I believe is is when it really started getting tested in court and I think you know more about this in many cases than I do when you start talking about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA is sort of old dirty work in the the 20th century is they abused their powers repeatedly and continuously they did active harm to domestic politics in the United States the FBI was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded in fact after MLK gave his I have a dream speech two days later the FBI classified him is the greatest national or I think it was the greatest national security threat in the United States and yet this is the FBI this is the the group that everybody's applauding today saying all these these wonderful Patriots and heroes now I'm not saying everybody the FBI is bad I'm not saying anybody everybody the CIA and the NSA is bad I'm saying that you don't become patriot based on where you work patriotism is not about a loyalty to government patriotism in fact it's not about loyalty to anything patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the P of your country right it's not about the government it's not about the state and this is well we'll get into loyalty later because you know I think one of the big criticisms against me there should be talked about is um they go look this guy is disloyal he broke an oath he did whatever a loyalty loyalty is a good thing when it's in the service of something good but it is only good when it's in the service of something good if you're loyal to a bad person if you're loyal to a bad program if you're loyal to a bad government that loyalty is actively harmful and I think that's overlooked but yeah when you get back into this whole thing about sort of where it came from why it happened how it could come out of just this small group and then they could slowly kind of poison by implication by complicity by bringing them into the conspiracy and then having them not say anything about it a wider and wider broad a body of people and then once you've got enough people in on it it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate because they can go look we've got 30 people who know about this and none of them have objected to it why are you gonna object to this all of this derives from that original sin which is in a democracy creating a system of government that is in fact a secret government a body of secret law body of secret policy that is far beyond what legitimate government secrets could be this is not saying like government hasn't can have no secrecy at all if the government wants to investigate someone without having them respond right we're talking traditional law enforcement sure you're not gonna tell this mobster hey you know we're gonna start investigating you we the public don't need to know the names of every terrorist suspect out in the world right but we do need to know again the powers and programs the policies that a government is asserting at least the broad outlines of it because otherwise how can we control it how do we know if the government is a it's authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing and so this is the the main thing and really the story behind the title permanent record is look Joe when you were a kid you know when I was a kid when you were a teenager riling what's the worst thing you've ever said you know did you say anything you weren't proud did you do anything that you weren't proud of something that today in like the whoa kissed of Twitter land you would get in trouble for I'm sure and that's one of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they do have all this stuff out there on social media forever and they can be judged horribly by something they did when they were 13 it's exactly that our worst mistakes our deepest shames were forgotten right they were lost they were ephemeral even the things we did get caught for they were known for a time maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us whether we like them or dislike them but they were people connected to us now we're forced to live in a real way naked before power whether we're talking about Facebook whether we're talking about Google whether we're talking about the government of any country they know everything about us or much about us rather and we know very little about them and we're not allowed to know more everything that we do now lasts forever not because we want to remember but because we're not allowed to forget just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements to be memorialized because every cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that and 18t keeps those records going back to 2008 under program called Hemisphere if you search for Hemisphere and AT&T you'll get a story in The Daily Beast about it 18 he keeps your phone records going back to 1983 if any year listeners were born after 1983 right born after me or it might be 1987 excuse me 1987 if they're born after 1987 and they're 18 is he customer or their calls cross 18 days network ATMs he has every phone call they ever made rather the record that had happened not necessarily the contents on the phone call um and so I mean let me turn this around for you Joe cuz I feel like I've just been given a given of speech when you look at this stuff right when you look at what's happening with government when you look at what's happening with the Trump White House the Obama White House the Bush White House you could see this trend happening when you look at what's happening with Facebook when you look at what's happening with Google when you look the fact that you go to every restaurant today and you see people look at the phones you know you get on a bus you get on a subway you know you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic you see people looking at phones these devices are connected all the time now people are getting Alexa right now now people have okay Google they have you know Siri on their phones that are in their house they've always got these connected microphones where do you think this leads and what is it that gives you sort of trust in the system faith in the system like how just-just-just so we can start a conversation here what strikes you about this well it's completely alien and it's new this is something that's unprecedented we don't have a long human history of being completely connected via technology this is something we're navigating right now for the first time and it's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information there's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history and we're figuring it out as we go along and what you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along but that to cover their ass these cellphone companies in cahoots with the government have made it legal for them to gather up all of your phone calls all of your text messages all of your emails and store them somewhere so that retroactive Lee if you ever say anything they don't like or do something they don't like they can go back find that and use it against you and we don't know who they are we don't know why they're doing it and we didn't know they could do it until you exposed it the the connection of human beings via technology is is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access to knowledge but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements track your phone calls track everything and under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from sleeper cells protecting us from attacks look if they really are attacked protecting us from these attacks that's great but there's there's no provision in the Constitution that allows any of this and this is where it gets really squirrely because they're making up the rules as they go along and they're making up these rules the way you're describing it this is step by step this has happened to sort of protect their ass and keep themselves from being implicated in what has been a violation of our rights and our privacy's and the Fourth Amendment yeah I mean I I think I think one of the things that everybody needs to understand when you look at these things and the reason you know we talked about before when I got this information why I didn't just put it on the internet and people criticize me for this they go I didn't share enough information because the journalists are gatekeeping right they've got a big archive and they haven't published everything from it and I told them not to publish everything why did you do that why did you do that because so again I get back to legitimate secrets an illegitimate secrets um some spying from my perspective you know career spy is okay right agreed if you have hacked a terrorists phone right and you're getting some information about that useful agreed yeah if you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a you know rocket division useful right but there there are lines and degrees in that where it's not useful now the examples that I just gave you these are targeted this is where you're spying on an individual there no named person that is being monitored for a specific reason that is related hopefully from a warrant people write well even for foreign intelligence and some indications you don't need a warrant strictly although I think they should have warrants for all of these investigations because they established a court for precisely this reason called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court right yeah and there's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying hey spy on Abu jihad over here right and if you want to spy on another guy Boris badenov with the rocket division right that that's okay they're gonna go with that but then you look at these edge cases and in the archive that I provided to journalists that meant stories that have come down where they've spied on journalists right they've spied on human rights groups and these kind of things I think people miss I'm gonna throw up some slides here so forgive me if this gets weird and I put up the wrong ones but since I came forward this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open courts to look at the program these are federal courts here right that said no actually these programs are unlawful they're likely unconstitutional when you start looking at the facts you see even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to the NSA and surveillance they say they broke their own laws you know two thousand seven hundred and seventy six times in a single year and then you asked about that thing that motivates me like why I came forward we had been trying as a country before I came forward to prove the existence of these programs legally because this is our this is our means of last sort of recourse in our system right we get the executive we got the legislature we got right so Congress makes the laws the executives supposed to carry them out the courts are supposed to play referee the executive had broken the laws Congress was turning a blind eye to the laws and the courts were and this is just months before I came forward going well it does appear that the ACLU and Amnesty International like all of these human rights groups and non-governmental organizations had established that you know these programs are likely unlawful they likely exist they're simply classified but the government responded with this argument that you just saw saying that well it's a state secret if they do exist you the plaintiffs don't have hard concrete evidence that they do exist and the government is saying legally you have no right to discover evidence from the government right documents demand documents or demand an answer from the government as to whether things these as to whether or not these things exist because the government's just gonna give its standard what they called Glomar response we can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist which leaves you out in the cold which leaves the courts out in the cold the courts go look the government could be breaking along here look they could be violating the Constitution here but because you can't prove it and because the government doesn't wanna play ball and the government says if we were doing this it would be legal and it would be necessary for national security or whatever the court can't presume to know national security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected and so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where okay if the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to establish the programs exist but the programs are classified so you can't establish they exist unless you have evidence but providing that evidence to courts to journalists to anyone is a felony right that's punishable by 10 years per count the Espionage Act and the government has charged every a source of Public Interest journalism who's really made a significant difference in these kind of cases since Daniel Ellsberg really going back to that under the same Espionage Act it's always the same law and this is there's no distinction to government between whether you've sold information to a foreign government for private benefit right or whether you provide an information only to journalists for the public interest and then that's a fundamentally harmful thing I think when you look at things that have come in the wake of this we're talking about the the post 2013 court rulings that found what the government was doing was unlawful you see the courts saying actually that leaks or air quotes leaks can actually be beneficial leak is used in the government's and this you know this is from a federal court these are not exactly my biggest supporters they are recognizing that although leak implies harm it implies something that's broken it's actually helpful it's a leak that's letting in daylight in this context that is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a context where one year before I came forward we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen we had hang on this famous exchange which more than anything made me realize this was a point of no return because I've told you this you've heard this but if you haven't seen it you might not believe me right maybe I'm a sketchy guy whatever one of those senators I told you that objected to this stuff that was doing the lassie barks for all those years Ron Wyden was confronting the most senior spy in the United States a General James clapper who was then the Director of National Intelligence right there's no guy higher than him the buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence he's testifying under oath in front of Congress right but more broadly in front of the public this is televised and ron wyden asked him a very specific question about a program mind you that ron wyden knows exists because he has security clearance he sits on the Intelligence Committee and he knows there's domestic mass surveillance and this is how it goes this is how the top spy responds under oath so what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly so that was a lie Wyden knew it was a lie clapper knew it was a lie he actually admitted it was a lie after I came forward you know three months later but he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of being in the hot seat there but what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress and the congressman even knows you're lying to them but they're afraid to correct you and widened by the way it wasn't a surprise Wyden gave him those questions twenty-four hours in advance and he wrote a letter afterwards asking for clapper to amend his testimony right now not even at a press conference but just to say this was incorrect whatever so he could go through the legal process and show his fellow congressmen that there was a problem and they needed to do it but all of that was refused to us all of it was denied to us and Here I am sitting at the NSA next to my buddies who I've talked to about these programs you know I've gone look at this and they're laughing at it you know I'm laughing at it and it's not it's not that we go oh ha ha ha he's getting away with it it's like what are you gonna do these guys are you know they're they're bullshitters that the system is built online that even many people many experts who have studied this know are lies but if you can't prove their lies how do you move beyond that and that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House so you're in this position where you have this information and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this what what makes you take the leap so this is covered extensively in the book because it took a long time I would imagine people people you know yeah right exactly people like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document like this stellar wind report and that's the closest thing to a smoking gun right that exists but look if you found that you you can read that later look at that and like imagine yourself being like oh I'm gonna go outside on the courthouse steps and wave this thing burn my life to the ground burn my family to the ground I'm never going to be work again I'm going to jail for the rest of my life the question is what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground too long the answer was nothing and I'm ashamed of that it took me so long to get over that home because I was waiting for somebody else to do it when I saw people like Ron Wyden on this when I saw people like the court case that I showed before where people were actively challenging these programs right journalists had the scent of it and you know there are a lot of people who are gonna be in the you knows of the YouTube comments or whatever go oh I knew this was happening no you didn't well Bill bimini you had he bill Binney he built built excuse me bill Binney he initially was the one that came out and spoke about this issue and so yeah bill Benny is a part of shall we say the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake bill Benny Kirk Wiebe I believe in Edie Loomis and these guys all got their doors kicked and you know they got harassed by the FBI Tom Drake who was a senior executive at the NSA this is a guy who had a lot to lose was charged under the same law was the Espionage Act and these guys were doing it earlier during the Bush administration some of them were talking to the journalists that in you know maybe it's alleged I don't want to put them on the spot maybe they deny it maybe they don't leave that to them but somebody somewhere was informing this reporting right that got into the New York Times about the Bush era warrantless wiretapping program and eventually journalists put this out there people knew these capabilities existed but yeah then there's the person in the YouTube comments so it's like oh we knew all about this is nothing new and the thing is you can know about some programs and not know about others you can have a suspicion you can know with a certainty that this stuff is capable or it is possible to capability exists you can know that the government has done this stuff in the past you can know they are likely to do it again you can have all these indications you can have like the jewel versus NSA case that's run by the e FF which is about the eighteen or it's about AT&T setting up secret rooms in their telecommunications facilities where they basically drag all the fibers for their domestic Internet communications and like phone communications into a room that's purpose-built for the NSA and then they bring it out but AT&T Nuys it's the NSA the NSA denies that these things happen or that are done at all right and so this is the context I you say you know and you know let's put it the other way maybe you do know right maybe you are an academic researcher maybe your technological specialist maybe you're just somebody who reads all the reporting and you actually know you can't prove it but you know this is going on but that's the thing in a democracy the distance between speculation and fact the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country is everything in our model of government because what you know doesn't matter what matters is what we all know and the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it if you can prove it and if you don't have the evidence you can't prove it and of course when we talk about the earlier stuff right like this or more corporatized media they've got a thousand incentives not to get involved in this stuff they need access to the White House they need these officials to sit down with them and give interviews right that's constant content that they need that's access that they need they need to be taken seriously they need to be a you know admitted to briefers it is a codependent relationship and yet rather and so the only way to make sure people understand this broadly is if we all work together all right if we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence right a body of facts that is so large and so persuasive it overcomes the natural and understandable resistance of these more corporatized media groups it overcomes the political and partisan sort of loyalties that that all of these political factions in the country do where they go you know it's it's my president even if I don't like this stuff even if I don't agree with this stuff I don't want to say it exists I want to deny it until it's proved you know in HD on video you know signing the order to do this that or the other because otherwise this is a chance my guy might not get reelected and that's the only way this kind of stuff can happen and the sad fact is the opportunities that we have to prove this like the the moments in history where we do prove something anything beyond a reasonable doubt are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers and I think that's one of the problems that we have particularly in that the climate movement did look go ahead I'm sorry did you take any comfort from knowing that Obama when he was running for office and in his hope and change website he had provisions to protect whistleblowers and provisions to to reward people right I mean do you remember all that I mean it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted it from the website from yes but that was a big part of his program or what he was running on was that when people were exposing unlawful activity he was going to protect those people did that did you take any comfort in this one campaigned well Obama also during his campaign said he campaigned actively against the warrantless wiretapping the bush ministration because remember Bush's in the scandal in the height of this on 2007 you know the elections coming up right after and he's going oh bomb Assange uh you know that's not who we are right not what we do and yet within a hundred days of him becoming president now he's sitting in that chair rather than extinguishing these programs he embraces them and expands why do you think that is more entrenched I think it's actually again what we talked about earlier first thing every time a new president comes into the White House they get their clearances right they get read into all this stuff during the campaign they get clearance isn't to get rid of that stuff but when they find the president right now they're the only people who can sign what these are called the covert action findings and things like that which are basically you know the intelligence community wants to assassinate somebody they want to run this illegal program here there or everywhere and they can't do it because their executive agencies without that top level executive sign-off fine so they got to open the vest right they got to get these guys on on side and basically every president since Kennedy they have been successful in what they call fearing up where as soon as they come in they lead you read you the litany of Horrible's and they go these are all the threats that we're facing and let's be real it is a dangerous world it's not just all made-up BS some of it is right where it's inflated it's not that it's completely false but they make it sound more serious than it actually is but there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things and you have just gone through a hellish election because our our electoral politics are so diseased and now after you've crawled through fire you're already thinking four years ahead you know how how do I stay in this seat and these guys are basically saying if you don't do X Y & Z this is gonna fall on your lap and the implication which I don't think they actually say but every president knows is these guys can undermine you to death if you've got the ISEE against you right they can Stonewall you they can put out stories that are gonna be problematic for you every day your presidency and it's not that it's necessarily gonna gonna catch you out of the White House but it's a problem that as president you very much don't want so in the most charitable interpretation of this you've got a new guy coming in in Obama's case this is a pretty young guy doesn't focus in this kind of national security foreign policy stuff throughout his earlier career he's more interested in domestic policy and always has been that's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama he's just trying to make things better at home and now suddenly they go look you need to worry about this country you need to worry about this group that you've never heard of you need to worry about you know this technology you need to do all this stuff and the only reason we can tell you this stuff and the only thing dividing America and the abyss are these terrible terrible terrible terror programs right that are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness and so here's here's the real problem every president hears that and every president you know first off they've got so many other things do is they just kind of nod their head and they'll go I'll deal with this later in my administration and this is one of the ironies when I come came forward in 2013 right this is now Barack Obama's second term president one of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance of the scandal was yes we think they went a little too far this is after the initial thing where they went nobody's listening to your phone calls you know just made a data right nobody nobody can have a perfect privacy and also have perfect security so we got to sort of divide a line here between the Constitution and you know what the government wants to do but they said we were gonna get to it we knew these programs were problematic but if they just gave us more time we would have fixed them maybe it's true right seems awful convenient in hindsight that throughout the entirety the first time well it seems like what you would say if you got caught right right right but look in if we're being the most generous that we are here the president is briefed on real and legitimate threats and they scare the hell out of them I'm sure and we can we can all imagine being there right those those of us who remember what the world was like post 9/11 fear is a powerful thing but the guys who are doing that briefing they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years this is the oldest thing they've given this briefing times before you know when we talk about people talk about the deep state right they talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people it's not that it's something much simpler the deep state is simply the career government it's the people who are in the same offices who outlive and outlast presidents is right they've seen Republicans they've seen Democrats they don't really care and they give that same briefing again and again and they get good at it they know what they want they know what this person saying where's the president they don't know who these people are these people who've been there before the president they're gonna be there after the president and so they give this very effective very fear inducing speech and then they followed up with their asks which are really demands just politely provided and anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff who is not ready for this sort of trade off and who you have to understand is a career politician is entirely used to the horse trading game Rango and I'll deal with this later or not now or what are the this the cost-benefit here and the intelligence community goes if you give us what we want no one will ever know about it because it's classified it's obviously the easy answer and maybe Barack Obama and honestly did want to get to this later but what we can say today is for all the good that may have been done in that White House this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not fix the problem but in fact made it worse well it seems like the president has a job it's absolutely impossible and if you come across someone who has been in the position like you know someone who's the head of an intelligence agency for a long time and it's very persuasive and has some you know legitimate credentials that show that he's very good at his job but he tells you this is important for national security we need to keep these things in place it doesn't seem like any one person can run the country and be aware of every single program that every single agency is implementing it seems completely unrealistic and the the job itself it just it doesn't seem like any person can do it adequately and when it comes to something like this mass surveillance state I could see a president being persuaded by someone who comes to him and says this is why we need to do this yeah I mean one of the things that I think is the underlying problem and everything that you just described as the president has too much power right and because they have too much power that means they have too much responsibility and I I don't think people understand if they haven't lived outside the United States if they haven't sort of traveled or studied broadly just how exceptional the American presidency is most countries don't have a single individual with this level of power it's really only the super States and and that may be by design perhaps that's why they're they're super States but when we look at sort of complex advanced democracies that are more peaceful they tend to have a more multilateral system that has more people involved in smaller portfolios and a lot of this derives from just the size of the government like you said you know the president is responsible for basically everything executive branch and the executive branch is basically every agency that actually doesn't work and so how do you how do you correct for that without breaking it up where you have smaller ministers and ministries and things like that that have different levels of responsibility having a smaller government overall you know back in 1776 the federal government you know was pretty much a dream we weren't even interested in having standing armies the idea of an army that existed from year to year was terrifying forbidding thing and then when you move to this idea that we have a president that they have these extraordinary powers it's okay because the government's very small the federal government especially is seen as sort of this small and toothless and weak thing keep pause for one second is Spain pause for one second because my ear pods are about to die and I'm gonna swap over to another pair these these suckers are good for a couple hours but we're two hours and 15 minutes here we'll have a little bit of a weird audio issue with the last half of it but Jamie Jamie I'll take care of it I wanted to talk about you like where you are right now in your life and how your hand this cuz you've been in exile for how many years now it's been more than six years six six years of 2013 yeah I mean well actually I left May so what is life like I mean are you in constant hiding I mean what what are the issues like in in the beginning my operational security level as we would call it was was very high I was concerned about being recognized was concerned about being followed I was concerned really about very bad things happening to me because the the government made it very clear that from their position I was the most wanted man in the world they literally brought down the president of Bolivia his aircraft and would not let it depart as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe not even the United States they wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board so yeah that made me a little bit nervous but you can't live like that forever and although I was as careful as I could be my still lived pretty happily because I was an indoor cat to begin with right I've always been a technologist I've always been pretty nerdy so as long as I have a screen an internet connection I was pretty happy but in the years past my life has become more and more open you know now I speak openly I live openly I go out I ride the Metro I go to restaurants like you know how often II recognized so this is a funny thing as I'm almost never recognized one of those things is I don't give Russian interviews because I don't want my face all over the news which is nice because it just allows people to sort of forget about my face and I can go about my life but I it's one of the weird things that I'm recognized a couple times a year even when I'm not wearing my glasses in a museum or a grocery store or something like that or out on the street just by somebody who I swear like these people are you might have read a story about them like super recognizers the people just have a great memory for faces yeah because I can be like ooh Oh wearing a hood and like a jacket it can have a scarf around my face like in the winter and it like you can barely see my face and they'll come up to me and they're like are you Snowden and I'm like whoa that's what he uses pretty impressive I'd say yeah it's nice to meet you and yeah they've it's I've never had a negative interaction from being recognized but for me none because I'm a privacy advocate like I would much rather go unrecognized like I don't want to be a celebrity but the other thing is I'll get recognized in computer stores and I think there's just like a mental Association where people are like their brain when it's cycling through faces that it recognizes it's going through like the subset of nerdier people or something like that when you're in a computer store because for whatever reason I'm recognized much more frequently when there's some kind of technological like locusts hmm so you're living freely did you had to learn Russian did you learn it yeah me my my Russian is still pretty crappy to talk to my great shame because all of my life all of my work is primarily aimed right right no you've talked about returning home if you could get a fair trial is is that a feasible thing a fair trial for someone like you is that such a well is that yeah that even possible question I mean look if we're being Frank III I think all your audience knows the chance of me getting a fair shake in the Eastern District of Virginia a couple miles from the headquarters of the CIA is probably pretty slim because that's where they draw the jury pool from right but my objection here is on a larger print right what what happens to me is less important right if I spend the rest of my life in jail that that's less important then what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to which is a single thing right they say face the music face the music and I'm saying great let's pick the song the thing is the law that I've been charged under the one that all these whistleblowers have been charged owner Thomas Drake Daniel Ellsberg Chelsea Manning Daniel Hale the drone whistleblower who is in prison right now going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing his lawyer is asking the court or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did that the government is violating the laws a government is violating human rights that these programs are immoral that they're unethical this is what motivated this guy to do it and the jury should be able to hear why he did what he did and the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong and the government has responded you know to this whistleblower argument basically saying we demand the court forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court he cannot talk about what motivated him he cannot talk about what was revealed why it was revealed what the impacts and effects were if he can't talk about whether the public benefited from it or was harmed by it because it doesn't matter now this might surprise a lot of people because to a lot of us we think that's what a jury trial is we think that's what a fair trial is but the Espionage Act that the government uses against whistleblowers meaning broadly here the sources of journalism is fairly unique in the legal system in that it is what's called a strict liability crime a strict liability crime is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder because if you if you murdered somebody like if you just don't know beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now you would be able to go to the court and say it was self-defense right yeah you you you felt threatened you were in danger for your life even if you weren't right even you obviously weren't even if you were on tape you could still argue that and the jury could go you full of crap right and they could convict you but if you were in fact acting in self-defense if the jury did in fact believe you they could take that into consideration in establishing their verdict right strict liability crime forbid then the jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime they're only allowed to consider if you committed a crime they are not allowed to consider if the murder was justified they are only allowed to consider if the murder took place and the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is telling the truth the Espionage Act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses against people who told the truth right like that that's what it's about in the context of journalism they don't bring the Espionage Act against people who lied then they would use fraud or some other statute they say the government is arguing in the context of whistleblowing the telling a telling a important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a crime worse than murder and I believe and I think most Americans would agree this is fundamentally in defensively wrong and so my whole argument with the United States government since the very beginning was been I'll be back for a jury trial tomorrow but you have to agree to permit whistleblowers a public interest offense it doesn't matter whether they are whistleblower or not it's just they argued it's the jury that decides whether they are always will blower or not if they have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did the government says we refuse to allow that because that puts the government on trial and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions Wow so you have had these conversations then so this has been discussed no this is this is from the Obama administration there's been no contact since since the Trump administration because the government basically when they got to this point they went we have no good argument against this and we will never permit this to happen and again I just want to make clear this is not speculation this is not me thinking this is actively happening in the case of Daniel Hale right now I hope you guys can pull up a graphic for because this story just the papers like two or three weeks ago saying the government is forbidding this guy from from making this argument so you're sitting in a state of limbo then you're they're not actively pursuing you it seems that if you're able to move around freely they they haven't discovered where you are you're just free to live your life you well yeah it's one of these things where you know whether they know where I am or whether they don't know where I am where I put my head on the pillow doesn't matter so much I'm in Russia right and and we should lean into that because I think people they hear Russia particularly in the context of today's news and you see like what people are saying about tulsi gabbard and things like yeah any kind of Association any any time your name appears in the same sentence in paragraphs same story is the word Russia it's considered a negative thing now yeah and don't get me wrong I've been a longtime critic of the Russian government I just actually had a major story written about me in a Russian state news outlet called RIA Novosti you guys could probably pull it it's only in Russian though that's saying because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition Alexei Navalny which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy I was saying look I think people have a right to express their opposition in a country and they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation in the future because the background here is this this opposition figure has been a long time in the Russian administration side and they've just suddenly magically been accused of being foreign agents or something like that and so everyone connected to this which is like a big civil society body I had their doors like simultaneously kicked in across the country and they're being investigated for some kind of corruption or something indeed doesn't even matter and you know I I said I opposed that just like I was tweeting you know footage of ballot stuffing in the Russian elections just like I've criticized the Russian president my name I've criticized Russian surveillance laws so many things again and again and again and again and again but yeah so look it does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose and people don't remember this I was actually on route to Latin America when the US government canceled my passport which trapped me in Russia and for those who are interested again I wrote an entire book that has a lot of detail on this but yeah it's difficult to be basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian government and it's it's a hard thing you know a it's not a happy thing but I feel like it's a necessary thing the problem is nobody wants to talk about that nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance nobody wants to consider it those kind of conversations in the current world people believe and this sexy were the worst things that Western media does in in the context of discussing Russia is they create this aura of invincibility around the Russian president they go you know this guy's calling all the shots he's pulling all the strings you know this guy's in charge of the world and that's very useful for the Russian government broadly because they can then take that and replay that on their domestic media and they go look how strong we are you know the Americans are afraid of us the Chinese are afraid of his everybody's afraid of us the French were afraid of us we are strong right there's no question that Russia is going to be interfering in elections there's no question that America is gonna be interfering in Russian elections right and nobody nobody likes to talk about this and again I need to substantiate that now that I've said that I've got an old note that I've signed a billion times the New York Times published a story in the wake of you know this contestant 2016 election where they looked into the history of electoral interference in Russia and the Soviet Union and they found in roughly 50 years 36 different cases of election interference by Russia or the Soviets right this is not a new thing this is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services do that's what they think they're being paid for which is a sad thing but it's a it's a reality because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from intelligence gathering but in that same study that they found 36 different cases by the Russians in the Soviets they found 81 different cases by the US and this was published by a Scott chain in the New York Times and both the Washington Post as well but this is this is the thing like there is a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life they just want to do better they want the same things that you do right and every time people go all Russia Russia Russia every time people go Russia bad every time they go Russia's doing this they go Russia's doing that Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that like do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump like do you want to be have Donald Trump's legacy around your neck and then people go oh well you know you could overthrow Donald Trump you know you could overthrow Putin can you really like is that how it works so yeah I mean look I have no affiliation I have no love for the Russian government it's not my choice to be here and I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home is there any concern that they would deny you visa I mean how how are you staying there it's it's a good question so I have a permanent residence people think I'm on our side no longer it's like a green card now it's got to be renewed every three years so yeah sure it's possible they could kick me out and this was what the story I was telling you about before in Russian media was they were saying you know the Russian government should take some action against me or shouldn't be welcome here or I should go home because why is he criticizing the Russian government right when they're the people is that like the Russian version of Fox News I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or Associated Press but the hell if I know but the the the thing is this what's the alternative right yes the Russian government could screw me but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything and so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are in Justices because it makes me safer well a lot of pragmatic people will say yeah they say you've done enough they saying you've done your part you know they say whatever be safe live long be happy but I didn't come forward to be safe if I wanted to be safe I'd still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you right and nobody ever would have known about this the system would have gotten worse but the system the world the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about every day that we stay silent about all the injustice as we see the world gets worse things get worse and yeah it's risky yeah it's uncomfortable but that's why we do it because if we don't no one else will all those years I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward and no one did right that's because I was waiting for a hero but there are no heroes right there's only heroic decisions you are never further than one decision away from making a difference doesn't matter where there's a big difference doesn't matter if it was a small difference because you don't have to save the world by yourself in fact you can't all you have to do is lay down one brick right all you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way so other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside and together step by step day by day year by year we build the foundation of something better but yeah it's not gonna be safe but it doesn't matter because individually it's it's not you know me whoever you are that's the Ironman well I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans if the world ends it's going to affect you we make things better we become safe together right collectively that is our strength that is the power of civilization that is the power that shapes the future because even if you make life great for you you're gonna die someday you're gonna be forgotten someday your cans of beans are gonna rot someday you can make things safe or you can be more careful right you can be more clever and there's nothing wrong with that but at the end of the day you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life you you're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you've lost is freedom you've lost the ability to act because you were afraid that's a beautiful into this mess that's a beautiful way to put it are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance and what if anything has changed since your revelations yeah I mean the big thing that's changed since I was in 2013 is now it's mobile first everything mobile was still a big deal right and the intelligence community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it but now people are much less likely to use laptop then use a desktop than then use you know God any kind of wired phone then they are to use a smart phone and both Apple and Android devices unfortunately are not especially good in protecting your privacy think right now you got a smartphone right you might be listening to this on a train somewhere and in traffic right now or you Joe right now you got a phone somewhere in the room right the phone is turned off or at least the screen is turned off it's sitting there it's powered on and if somebody sends you a message the screen blinks to life how does that happen but how is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number your phone rings and nobody else's rings how is it you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings right every smartphone every phone at all is constantly connected to the nearest cellular tower every phone even when the screen is off you think it's doing nothing you can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible it's screaming in the air saying Here I am Here I am here is my IMEI I think it's an individual manufacturers Equipment Identity and IMEI individual manufacturers subscriber identity I could be wrong on the break out there but the the acronyms are the IMEI and the IMSI and you can search for these things there are two globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place right this makes your phone different than all my other phones the IMEI is burned into the hand side of your phone no matter what SIM card you changed to it's always gonna be the same and it's always gonna be telling the phone network it's this physical handset the IME si is in your SIM card right and this is what holds your phone number right it's the basically the key the right to use that phone number and so your phone is sitting there doing nothing you think but it's constantly shouting and saying I'm here who is closest to me that's a cell phone tower and every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and going alright I see Joe Rogan's phone right I see Jaime's phone I see all these phones they're here right now and it compares notes with the other Network towers and your smartphone compares notes with them to go who do I hear the loudest and who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity for closeness distance right they go whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else that's close to me so you're gonna be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone tower is gonna make a note a permanent record saying this phone this phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me right and based on your phone handset and your phone number they can get your identity right because you pay for this stuff with your credit card and everything like that and even if you don't right it's still active at your house overnight it's still active you know on your nightstand when you're sleeping it's still whatever the movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person and those are often quite ly uniquely identifying it goes to your home it goes to your workplace other people don't have it sorry and anyway it's constantly shouting this out and then it compares notes with the other parts and network and when somebody is trying to get to a phone it compares notes of the network compares notes to go where is this phone with this phone number in the world right now and to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone it sends out a signal saying we have a call for you make your phones start ringing so your owner can answer it and then it connects it across this whole path but what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone ever the phone is turned on there's a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies it does not need to be kept forever and as fact there's no good argument for it to be kept forever but these companies see that is valuable information Ryan this is the whole big data problem that we're running into and all this information that used to be ephemeral right where were you when you were 8 years old you know we're worried where'd you go after you had a bad breakup you know who'd you spend the night with who'd you call after all this information used to be ephemeral meaning it disappeared right like like the morning dew it would be gone no one would remember it but now these things are stored now these things are saved it doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong it doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on earth because that's how bulk collection which is the government's euphemism for mass surveillance works they simply collected all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful and that was just talking about how you connected phone network that's not talking about all those apps on your phone that are contacting the network even more frequently right how do you get a text message notification how do you get an email notification how is it the Facebook knows where you're at you know all of these things these analytics they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone to GPS through even just what wireless access points you're connected to because there's a global constantly updated map there's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world because just like we talked about every phone has a unique identifier that's globally unique every wireless access point in the world right you cable modem at home whether it's in your laptop every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it and this is standard term you can look it up and these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air because again like your phone says to the cell phone tower I have this identifier the cell phone tower responds and says I have this identifier and anybody who's listening they can write these things down and all there's Google Street View cars that go back and forth right they're keeping notes on whose Wi-Fi is active on this block right and then they build a new giant map so even if you have GPS turned off right as long as you connect to the Wi-Fi those apps can go well I I'm connected to Joe's Wi-Fi but I can also see his neighbor's Wi-Fi here and the other one in this apartment over here and the other one in the apartment here and you should only be able to hear those four globally unique Wi-Fi access points from these points in physical space right the intersection in between the spreads the domes of all those wireless access points it's a proxy for location and it just goes on and on and on we could talk about this for four more hours we don't have that kind of time can I ask you this is there a way to mitigate any of this personally I mean is shutting your phone off doesn't even work right well so it does in a way it's just no uhm the thing was shutting your phone off that is a risk is how do you know any phones actually turned off it used to be when I was in Geneva for example working for the CIA we would all carry like drug dealer phones you know the old smart phones there sorry old dumb phones they're not smart phones and the reason why was just because they had removable battery bags where you could take the battery out right and the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it right if there's no go juice available to it if there's no battery connected to it it's not sending anything because you have to get power from somewhere you have to have power in order to do work but now your phones are all sealed right you can't take the batteries out so there are potential ways that you can hack a phone where it appears to be off but it's not actually off it's just pretending to be off whereas in fact it's still listening in and doing all this stuff but for the average person that doesn't apply right and I got to tell you guys they've been chasing me all over the place I don't worry about that stuff right and it's because if they are applying that level of effort to me they'll probably get the same information through other routes I am as careful as I can and I use things like Faraday cages I turn devices off but if they're actually manipulating the way devices display it's just too great a level of effort even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis also if they get me I only trust phones so much so there's only so much they can derive from compromise and this is how operational security works you think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate and with the mitigation that you're trying to do is what would be the loss what would be the damage done to you if this stuff was exploited much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call voodoo hacks right which are like next-level stuff and actually just a shout out for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff fun I wrote a paper on this specific problem how do you know when a phone is actually off how do you know when it's actually not spying on you with a brilliant brilliant guy named Andrew bunny Huang he's an MIT PhD and I think electrical engineering called the introspection engine that was published in the Journal of hope and engineering you can find it online and it'll go as deep down in the weeds I promise you it as you want we take an iPhone 6 this was back when it was fairly new and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state but physically monitor its state to see if were spying on you but for average people right this academic that's not your primary thread your primary threats are these bulk collection programs your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers it's doing all of these things because we leave our phones a mistake that is constantly on your constantly connected right airplane mode doesn't even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore it just turns off the cellular modem but the whole idea is we need to identify the problem and the central problem with smart phone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time like the phone has the screen off you don't know what it's connected to you don't know how frequently it's doing it Apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to inter mediate them going I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now you know I don't want Google to be able to talk right now I just want my secure messenger app to be the talk I just want my weather app to be able to talk but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it so I don't want that to be able to talk anymore and we need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by app basis but a connection by connection basis right you want let's say you use Facebook because you know for whatever judgment we have a lot of people might do it you want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers you want to be able to message a friend you want to be able to download a photograph or whatever but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server you don't want it to talk to an analytics server that it's monitoring your behavior right you don't want to talk to all these third-party things because Facebook crams their garbage and almost every app that you download and you don't even know what's happening because you can't see it right and this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible and what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices whether it's a phone whether it's computer or whatever more visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control over it so like if you could see your phone right now and at the very center of is a little green icon that's your you know handset or it's a picture your face whatever and then you see all these little spokes coming off of it that's every app that your phone is talking to right now or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that it's connecting to and you can see right now what's every three seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you could just poke that app and then BOOM it's not talking to Facebook anymore Facebook's not allowed Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked right you would do that we would all do that if there was a button on your phone that said do what I want but not spy on me you would press that button right that button is not a does not exist right now and both Google and Apple unfortunately Apple's a lot better at this than Google but neither of them allow that button to exist in fact they actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk and from a particular perspective they actually aren't wrong there but it's not enough to go you know we have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust they would make the right decisions we think it's too complicated for people to do this we think there's too many connections being made well that is actually a confession of the problem right there if you think people can't understand it if you think there are too many communications happening if you think there's too much complexity in there it needs to be simplified just like the president can't control everything like that if you have to be the president of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government we have a problem guys this should be a much more simple process it should be obvious and the fact that it's not and the fact that we read story after story year after year saying all your date has been breached here this companies spying on you here this companies manipulating your purchases or your search results or they're hiding these things from your timeline or they're influencing your you are manipulating it in all of these different ways that happens as a result of a single problem and that problem is in any quality of available information they can see everything about you they can see everything about what your device is doing and they can do whatever they want with your device you on the other hand owns the device well rather you paid for the device but increasingly these corporations on it increasingly these government's own it and increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work right we pay all the taxes we pay all the costs but we own less and less and nobody understands this better than the youngest generation well it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was it became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms before we understood what we were giving up they were making billions of dollars and then once that money is being earned and once everyone's accustomed to this situation it's very difficult to pull the reins back it's very difficult to turn that horse around precisely because the money then becomes pot right right the information that becomes influence that also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these mass surveillance dates once they have the access it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that right yeah no you're you're exactly correct and this is the the subject of the book I mean this is this is the permanent record and this is where it came from this is how it came to exist the story of our lifetimes is how intentionally by design a number of institutions both governmental and corporate realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out through society remember back in the day intelligence collection in the United States even at Sigyn used to mean sending an FBI agent right to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in somebody disguised as a workman and they put a bug in a building or they built a satellite listening site right we called these foreign said were foreign satellite collection we're on the desert somewhere they built a big parabolic collector and it's just listening to satellite emissions right but these satellite emissions these satellite links were owned by militaries they were exclusive to governments right it wasn't affecting everybody broadly all surveillance was targeted because it had to be what changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate it could become dragnet it could become bulk collection which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language if we have any kind of decency but we were intentionally this was intentionally concealed from us right the government did it they used classification companies did it they intentionally didn't talk about it they denied these things were going they said you agreed to this and you didn't greeted nothing like this I'm sorry right they go we put that Terms of Service page up and you that you clicked a button that said I agree because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends you were trying to get driving directions you were trying to get an email account you weren't trying to agree to some 600 page legal form that even if you read you wouldn't understand and it doesn't matter even if you did understand because one of the very first paragraphs and I said this agreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company right they have built a legal paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us this is sort of one of the core principles on which mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal and you have to understand that all the stuff we talked about today government says everything they do is legal right and they go so it's fine our perspectives the public should be well that's actually the problem because this isn't okay the scandal isn't how they're breaking the law the scandal is that they don't have to break the law and the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party doctrine the third party doctrine is a legal principle and derived from a case and I believe the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland and Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady making phone calls to her house and when she would pick up you just I don't know is that their heavy breathing whatever like a classic creeper and you know it was terrifying this poor lady so she calls the cops and says one day I got one of these phone calls and then I see this car creeping past my house on the street and she got a license-plate number so she goes the cops and she goes is this the guy and the cops again they're trying to do a good thing here they look up his license-plate number and they find out where this guy is and then they go what phone number is registered to that house and they go to the phone company and they say can you give us this record the phone company says yeah sure and it's the guy the cops got their man right huh so they go arrest this guy and then in court his lawyer brings all this stuff up and they go um you did this without a warrant that was sorry that was that was the the problem was they went to the phone company they got the records without a warrant they just asked for it or they subpoenaed it right some lower standard of legal review and the company gave it to him and got the guy they march amok in jail and they could have gotten a warrant right but it was just expedience they just didn't want to take the time with small-town cops you can understand how it happens they know the guy's a creep or they just want to get him off to jail and so they made him I said but the government doesn't want to let go they fight on this and they go it wasn't actually they weren't his records and so because they didn't belong to him he didn't have a Fourth Amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them they were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and hence no warrant was required because you can give whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours now here's the problem the government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known suspected criminal who had they had real good reasons suspect suspect was their guy and used that to go to a company and get records from them and establish the precedent these records don't belong to the guy they belong to the company and then they said well if one person doesn't have a Fourth Amendment interest in records held by a company no one does and so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives and remember this is back in the 1970s you know the internet hardly exists in these kind of contexts smartphones you know don't exist modern society modern communications don't exist this is the very beginning of the technological era and flash-forward now 40 years and they are still relying on this precedent about this one you know pervy creeper to go nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company and so long as they do that companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinarily abusive and this is something that people don't get they go oh well it's data collection right they're exploiting data this is data about human lives mistake about people these records are about you it's not data that's being exploited it's people that are being exploited it's not data that's being manipulated it's you that's being manipulated and this this is this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand the problem is the companies in the government's are still pretending they don't understand were disagreeing with this and this is reminds me of something that one of my old friends John Perry Barlow who served with me at the freedom of the press foundation I'm the president of the board he used to say to me which is you can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep he said it's an old Native American saying that's a great expression it's a good way that I think that's a good way to end this thank you very much for doing this I really appreciate it please tell everybody the title of your book and it's it's available right now sure yes it is it's on shelves everywhere at least until the government finds some other way to ban it it is called a permanent record and I hope you'll read it I will read it and I think what you've done is incredibly brave and I think you're a very important part of history I think when all is said and done what you did and what you exposed is gonna change the way we view mass surveillance change the way we view government oversight and it changed the way we view the distribution of information I really think it's very very important and it was an honor to talk to you man thank you it was my pleasure thank you so much for having take care yourself man stay safe no no no no don't stay safe stay safe open space days free open to possibilities take care thank you [Music]", "Episode Title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1368 - Edward Snowden", "Date": "2019-10-23T13:00:07Z", "URL":

sorry about looks good you know ah look at that a little bit of starry night there yeah you're really into them huh oh yeah I got I got is that yes oh you remembered yeah yes yeah yeah it's on the phone starry night I like about starry night it's not what van Gogh saw that night it's what he felt how do you know what he felt because this is not a representation of reality and anything that deviates from reality is reality that has filtered through your senses and I think art at its highest is exactly that if this was an exact depiction of reality it would be a photograph and I don't need the artist hmm okay so even photographs that take you to a slightly other kind of dimension as you gaze upon them it's more than what was actually going on at the time and that's that's art taken to the craft of photography and that's why you like it that's one of the reasons why plus I think it was the very first painting where its title is the background think about that this could have been called you know in the full painting obviously this is a snippet yeah yeah so there's a town there there's a cypress tree there's a church steeple it could have been called the cypress tree it could have been called sleepy village it could have been called rolling hills but no it's called starry night and everything in front of it everything in front of it is just in the way and how often do you paint something where the title is the background that that's my point and in this particular case the background is the universe and soap so for me this was a pivot point in art and it's 1889 which is recent given the history of paintings and you know there go all the way back so yeah there it is that your favorite painting ever I have to say yeah yeah a vest and a fire if it's not what are you doing for for five ties that have this painting on them in different ways yeah so I'm all-in I'm all-in what's interesting is that the town is what have you seen starry night in bacon somebody did look dig it up on the screen today somebody did it in bacon it's just crazy weird yes yeah how weird go back to the original one please what's interesting about the original one is that the town is realistically depicted the trees are recognizable as trees if you ever saw a sky that looked like that the end would be here yeah exactly Plus then swirling is not wind and it's not clouds because if it was if it was clouds you wouldn't see the Stars right what started it's how he felt that's all I can tell you by the way that is a real evening so that's sorry it's not even it's early morning the crescent moon when it's that orientation means this is before sunrise and that white object lower on the horizon that sort of glowy that's very likely Venus and that enables us to trace what's over what set of weeks this painting was actually painted so it's kind of like forensic astronomy has anyone done an analysis of like where he must have been yeah yeah that's well-known yeah he was in a real place and so that he didn't pull this out of his ass right I mean it was he painted what he saw folded into what he felt yeah that's how art should be I think yeah otherwise would what do you need artists for make cool [\u00a0__\u00a0] the cool stuff is something that they felt and it came out of them yeah and they feel stuff they artists feel feel the natural world in ways different from the rest of us and that's why they're artists do they or do they just express it with oh sorry yes they not only yes we all can feel it but to be able to express it that that's a whole other talent right just you know what I think about often why do you why do we all know who Paul Revere is all right we all we it's a household name yet is there any other war ever fought in the history of the world where whole name is the name of the person who told other people the enemy was coming we can mention his name but we can't list the generals that all fought in that war why it's because a poem was written about him and he had this mundane job let me tell people the enemy is coming and so the artist in this case the poet elevated the mundane to something that forces you to to reckon it with your understanding of this world what joyce joyce kilmer is most famous poem it's about a tree dogs piss on trees you drive by trees you don't even know they're there yet a poem about a tree I'll never see something as lovely as a tree oh my gosh this so the art forces you to pause and just reflect on things that you took for granted things that became ordinary in your life and they were elevated to - - they get beatified by the talents of artists that's a word o beatify you never know we a defy yeah I'm using it loosely it's the intermediate step between being an ordinary person and being a saint the beatification of someone in the Catholic Church I want thought it's making something more beautiful oh babe okay I don't it could have similar roots being sad would be yeah good it could come from that but to be it be beatified is the first steps on route to sainthood yeah that's if I remember the word correctly goes oh you gotta hold up the definition to make supremely happy Christianity declare to have attained blessedness of heaven and authorized the title blessed and limited public religious honor she was beatified six years after her yes so I think you can't become a saint unless you previously been beatified I think that's the rule but I'm looking at the number one definition there to make supremely happy so that's that's interesting yeah that that yeah that moved ahead of a definition of beatify yeah so it's a to be out of fight where the the verb was up there you had on the screen Roman Catholic Church he beatified one diego an indian believed to have a vision of a Virgin Mary synonyms canonized sanctify how a consecrate so I think if you take something ordinary and you subject it to the interpretation of an artist it can be beatified and elevated on a level where it becomes a household recognition of its importance in this world hmm so my brother's an artist my brother's an artist so I'm kind of a fine art but also paints and he teaches history of art so I I've had this sort of baptism my whole life being exposed to him I'm the you know the the sibling scientist but the they have an artist in the family I this everyone should have an artist in family I've got an uncle and of course the the whole steam movement science technology engineering and math the artist got in they say wait I'm sort of stem the stem movement they want to throw in the a to get art as part of that movement science technology engineering art and math changing from stem to steam its esteem so you get full steam ahead steam is a better word in that well they both good words for what they need but that just sounds like a bunch of awesome stuff like it does and yeah I'm not throwing comedy and it's like the lbgtq a really squirrely when you start adding more letters yeah you can add letters but if it doesn't spell anything then the memorization has to kick in but steam you don't have to memorize that it's already there for you so it's cleverly conceived I think it the abbreviation was its tacit recognition that these are elements in society that advanced civilization and grow the economy actually so in fact there's hardly any growth economy in the world that isn't growing because it has been frettin not having been touched by science or technology everything just think about it so if you're around running you don't have them on your show but if you run around saying I don't like science science is bad science is evil okay well then you will die in poverty if you elect officials who believe that as well who the [\u00a0__\u00a0] thinks that science is bad in 2019 and how do they express this they express it through sign okay so you know I'm saying like are they saying it online I have a book coming out in a month called letters from an astrophysicist okay yeah it's it's not it's not out yet I've got it it's not how did you get a copy but I don't even have my copy yet okay what I'm saying in there I there's a whole chapter on just angry people who don't like anything including science and one of them it's a it's a it's a riff he just said I hate it and it signs it and that science does bring some of the worst things that's ever happened to humanity and pollution and this he goes on and on and on and on and on and so I reply his letters from a national physicist and I and I reply as calmly and as rationally as as possible when you get attacked that way but what I'm saying is not everyone embraces everything that science does and some will cherry-pick it you have the science deniers for a global warming of science deniers with vaccines you have science and IRAs with GMOs you know there's there's all manner of science denying going on in modern society and you know we in a free society what are you gonna do right that people can think what they want but if if thinking what they want influences policy which then affects everybody then your science denial has consequences to the economic health of the nation and by the way it's not only economics it's your the economic health it's your physical health because medicine flows through advances in science as well as our security well there's people that deny some aspects of science while conveniently using other that's where it gets weird right you're driving a car that's relying on GPS you're using a phone to complain about the global warming hoax you know you're correct what one of my more more sort of popular tweets was you remember when they we had the photo of the black hole from a distant galaxy and it was banner headlines maybe a year ago less than a year ago banner headlines and first photo ever of a black hole and it was an astounding engineering achievement to accomplish that it was multiple telescopes all around the world pooling the data to get it right and it was one of the greatest collaborative efforts we've ever undertaken in my field of astrophysics okay and everybody was loving the results so all I tweeted was scientist report first photo of a black hole public scientists report humans are warming the earth oh no you brought it up ok scientists we produce the first ever image of a supermassive black hole 55 million light years away the response scientist we've concluded that humans are catastrophic ly warming the earth response that conflicts with what I want to be true so it must be false well that is the cherry-picking of science it is the cherry-picking assignments but the global warming thing is very much connected to a certain type of ideology a certain type of person thinks to the matter to me no nonsense person what I'm saying yes it does matter what I'm what I'm trying to say is that is a demographic that has cherry-picked science to deny human-caused global warming there are other Democratic demographics said of cherry-picked other science to deny other things and it's not all located in one political spectrum I mean one political branch right so you tend to find liberal folk complaining that the conservatives who have embraced know the gluten no global warming platform are denying science and they need science on their side and many of those same people are rubbing crystals together to be healed by the crystal energy or they're denying vaccines thinking that there's somehow bad for you and so so all of this requires sum or total rejection of mainstream science and we're living in that world now and I don't know I don't think it'll stop the progress of civilization but it can certainly slow it down and occasionally stall it well that is certainly a problem but how big of a problem is it like how many people are really in denial of science in 2019 and it's got to be for me in a free country that's not what matters what matters is in a free country that you elect officials who are not officials yes you you elect people who are scientifically literate yeah they don't have to be scientists I or and if they're not scientifically literate they should be self-aware of that and then listen to people who are right so don't you think what they're doing though is they're they're doing what their constituents would like them to do that's why I don't beat politicians over the head ever I don't do that we're we're we're Republic we're democracy whatever they believe if they think earth is 6,000 years old and they got elected it's because the people elected them believe there's he earth is 6,000 years old or because they're willing to let that one go because they believe in Oh possibly that's a good point because you have a portfolio of thoughts and beliefs or because he's such a profound Christian I mean he's so profoundly Christian that he's plenty of Legends who are connected to science that don't including the Pope by the way you know can you get more Christian than the Pope all right he believes in science now this new pope is pretty interesting if you read if you read his encyclical from a couple of years ago it's it's it's a scientifically literate doc document yeah and know this okay so it's not he's still religious right so Jesus still rose from the dead and there was still miracles and all the rest of that in the New Testament so he's not in denial of that but given that he is saying oh my gosh here's something we the religious community and scientists can partner behind and that if we want to save life on Earth and so we have to be better shepherds of what is going on on this earth and one of them is we don't want to flood low-lying countries in the South Pacific where the average sea level is 10 feet above sea level or whatever it is you're gonna lose these countries if you keep melting our-our-our the nothing ice caps because that would include a north and there's no land in the north so the glacier ice that's land-based ice right because any ice that's in the water floating that can melt and it's not going to change the water level so it's why you can do this experiment it's really cool fill up your glass put some few cubes of ice in a glass of water fill the glass up as much as you possibly can without spilling it and the ice is bobbing above that level okay because ice is about 10% buoyant on that about 10 percent of an ice cube will be lifted above this is this is the this is the iceberg equation right all right that's the tip of the iceberg well you see the 10% above and 90% is not visible to you this is by the way I don't want to get to too many off-ramps here but that's one of the one of the things that they did right in Titanic okay if you look at the earliest Titanic movie that was in black and white they see this huge iceberg on the horizon and then it can they can't square away from it because it oh my gosh it doesn't have to no no the iceberg that cuts the bottom of your boat is a little bit I sticking out above the water because 90% of it is underwater and that's where the damage occurs and in the James Cameron Titanic the iceberg that they hit above water was looks like a little chunk of ice no that couldn't hurt anything all the damage was under work anyhow so back to this so do this experiment and then let the glass sit there and let the ice melt and the water level will stay the same because when ice melts it gets takes up lower volume than it was when it became ice mmm and that's why pipes break I thought pipes break just because the water expands yeah I just described that in the opposite direction oh I didn't know it gets larger that's what expansion means what kind of with your vocabulary here right now but I'm saying like so your ice cube is sitting at 10% of your ice cube is sitting 10% above the water level and it melts and becomes water the water takes up 90% of the volume of the ice right so that just melts back into the water and it doesn't overflow even though we're sticking above the water line when you had the glass so now let's do the opposite okay there's water in the pipes well can I tell you something that might blow your mind no how many times does your mind you at least once a day yeah at least we need your mind blown okay here's how it works okay so let's put water in the pipes okay and then the temperature drops the pipes have a certain strength right copper pipes you know they're rigid and I grew up around Bray and pipes okay so no Massachusetts so the waters in there and now the temperature begins to drop okay the water wants to turn to ice but it can't because the pipe is containing it so it just sits there okay at 32 degrees as water even though the temperature outside is dropping below 32 degrees okay and it still sits there guess the 30 degrees 29 the pipe is squeezing the attempt of this water to become ice and the act of squeezing it prevents the temperature from dropping okay and you as the temperature drops depending on how strong the pipe is and and the temperature gradient across it as the outside temperature continued it gets to now 25 degrees the pipe is still holding on to the liquid water and it's still 32 degrees inside there and it olds on to it and this keeps happening it keeps having you get a point where the pipe can no longer contain the water and the water freezes spontaneously it just goes right down to that temperature and the pipe is helpless in the face of this so the point is the stronger the pipe is the lower the temperature has to be outside for the freezing water to break so theoretically if you had a pipe that was made of a stronger material than copper you can get even lower than you get even lower temperatures how low can you get I cuz that when things freeze they have to expand so what not only when water freezes water expand when it's it's it's a it's a remarkable fact about water that is shared by very few other ingredients most things when they cool they shrink as all men know so so so most most materials because things cooler the vibrating molecules slow down and they take up less space water is the opposite of that as it passes down through so so I'm gonna describe to you an extraordinary fact about water and why we're alive today okay so watch this let's take a lake that has fish in it okay temperature drops outside and the lake slowly begins to get cooler because there's a tank time lag between the air temperature and the waters that's why the first freeze the lake is still there it's got to be cold longer alright so what happens the water gets cold on the surface okay and it begins to okay the water gets cold on a surface and it begins to shrink so that water falls this shrink that makes a denser it falls to the bottom fine it does that down to about four degrees Celsius as it goes from 43 Celsius to zero degrees Celsius the freezing point it begins to expand and become less dense than the water so now as the water wants to actually freeze it stays on top when it does freeze you freeze the top surface of the lake well how about the water below it it's insulated from the dropping air temperature and the fish don't die imagine if ice were denser than water what would happen you'd freeze the top layer it would sink the bottom is frozen freeze the next layer it sinks and fish would be systematically forced to swim in shallower and shallower waters until they were all freeze dried on the top surface of the lake and all fishes would be dead every winter I think it's every Lake things fish what I think you supposed to say fishes fishes is a double plural you could do that yeah you know fish would be dead you know I'm all deer would you say all deers well because generally it's one if you had multiple kinds of deer yeah so if you had like yeah but it's rare that they're all in the same place you generally have one kind of do normally but if the ocean has many kind of fish in the same place oh yeah that's interesting so you'd say fishes fishes it's like it's a double floor it's different kinds of plural fish yeah double blow my mind the many fishes in the oh yeah yeah yeah so sorry she's in the sea yeah so multiple plurals of different have to get we're ocean water freezes salty salt water do you have the word fishes up there some weird anomaly that happened where there was two or little oxygen in the water and somehow the frozen fish got pushed out in a wall of ice South Dakota so there's too little oxygen I don't know I can't explain that over there if you look at the if you look at the green in the water most likely it's algae so that happens with certain lakes that get polluted with certain types of a you can kill the lake but by doing that well you get it in the ocean to get these zones but I don't see how you get frozen fish though that's incredible but stop go back up yeah scroll down so we could read it fish frozen a wall of ice and South Dakota's Lake Andes National Wildlife Refuge that's incredible man is that a video Jaime yeah I don't know how they froze because they can just swim to where it's not frozen so I'd have to I'd have to do more homework on that one to see what what caused that Wow so my point is because of this property of water that ice floats it insulates the bottom layers of the lake and fish can survive over the winter that's work too right insulate so you can inside you get a yeah sure yeah yeah I mean if you put a barrier between you and the changing elements outside that's basically an insulating layer ice fishing know I never know that a university life person wait do women go ice fishing to get away from their husbands they do yeah why do people golf you know the ice fishing is particularly weird because you have to continually scoop out the ice and maybe even drill again right so that works because frozen water is less dense than non frozen water and it's one of the rare ingredients for which that's oh and it's likely there would be no life on land or anywhere on earth if that were the case if the opposite of that were the case so water is a very special ingredient to life on earth it's cited by many religious folks is saying see earth is sacred for these it's in the list of special ingredients for what make earth habitable for life that is a really strange thing though that if you can contain it somehow an incredibly strong pipe yes it won't freeze yes it won't freeze what is a temper is there a number well that's why that's why pipes don't freeze when it just hits 30 degrees outside that's not when you hear it it freezes when it gets really low when you crack it yeah and then it'll break the copper like it's paper and tear it like it's like it's nothing now on the flip side of that try this at home take an ice cube that's like at 30 degrees okay how would you measure that pull out an ice cube and just because there'll be at near zero Fahrenheit if you if you have a good freezer just pull out and leave it on the counter put put it on a wooden cutting board okay and just let it sit there for like 10 minutes and it's temperature will come up there'll be a point where it hasn't melted yet but you can take it and squeeze the ice cube and you can force it to melt by squeezing it because you're forcing it into a smaller volume that it currently contains and the only way you can accomplish that is if the ice turns to water then it will occupy a smaller volume so the act of squeezing ice can actually melt it so if you had some sort of a pipe that could physically constrict like something that had threads it in there could wind down to a smaller size you could stick a cylinder of ice in it and you could slowly crank it oh yeah yes yes it would melt yes you can melt if you have some machine that squeezed ice yeah and the colder the ice is the hard this the the more you the the harder it would be for you to squeeze it to accomplish that so it's sort of fun with ice in fact you know what else you can do this is a harder experiment to do if you take us a a mesh like a screen mesh that's to be sort of wider openings then a screen door would so what would this be like a fence like a chain-link fence and hold horizontally and get a big block of ice and just place it on top a block of ice is heavy what will happen is the ice the weight of the ice will melt the ice in the contact points of the chain itself because it's feeling that pressure to squeeze it into a smaller volume but by the time it melts the ice has now passed through the grate and it will refreeze on the other side so you can actually pass a block of ice through a chain-link fence vertically just by pushing it yeah it's pretty it's pretty cool it's a slow experiment but it's wrong I meet depends on the temperature the ice and how and how and how much it weighs because the pressure is what this is why this is why you can ice skate why can you skate on ice because the edge of the blade is very high pressure on the ice and it's melting a bead of order you're actually gliding on water when you're skating you're not skating on slippery ice really yes I thought you were just cutting the ice with the blade well so the blade have you ever seen a sharpened blade it's not just flat there's actually a concave cross-section to it so each edge the left edge and the right edge is is basically at a knife edge mm-hmm okay not quite as sharp as a knife but it's you can feel how it's it's sharp so that when you lean on that edge either your inner edge or outer edge your entire bodyweight is being held up on this on a very narrow surface area of the blade so the pressure is extreme it's like you know thousand pounds per square inch you don't weigh a thousand pounds but you're not skating on a square inch right so you you do the math on that and what you can have is you will skate and you're actually what makes it so slippery on ice skates is because you're moving on a bead of water that freezes right behind you as you go past it dude yeah so it's possible for ice to be so cold you can't really skate on it because even that pressure is not enough to melt it how cool would it have to be that I last I did a calculation was really cold like tens of degrees below zero how does dry ice work oh it's just frozen carbon dioxide that's all so here's the difference here's the difference you have a block of frozen h2o and a block of frozen co2 so there they are it turns out the air pressure on earth is high enough at sea level is high enough to allow the ice to melt and sustain a liquid state okay the co2 under air pressure normal air pressure it wants to melt but it can't sustain a liquid and it goes straight to gas if we had much higher air pressure you could you could have co2 melt and have liquid co2 so now watch what happen so so okay kind of blow your mind again this is just this is really good stuff okay it's good like physical chemistry so here you go so watch it happens so what happens if I reduce the air pressure okay well the transition from ice to water is still the same it's not affected but the boiling point is affected as you know cooking times have to be adjusted on mountaintops because when you boil water it's not 212 degrees depending on the height of the mountain there's less air pressing down that that's preventing it from boiling okay the boiling point is not some absolute facts about the water it has to do with what the air pressure is sitting above it if you have extremely high air pressure water has to go to a much higher temperature before it boils so our so the boiling point of water that's reported in all textbooks is at sea level at one atmospheric pressure that's how you get 212 degrees if you start reducing the atmospheric pressure it's 210 degrees 205 degrees 200 degrees 190 degrees 180 degrees 180 oh yes and so that's not as hot as 212 degrees so you got to cook the food longer all cooking times are increased for this reason so now watch I'm not done with you Oh let's keep reducing the air pressure okay theoretical like possible on earth no no Himalayas yeah but or take it up you can ascend in some kind of copter or some kind of device our air balloon or whatever but I'm saying you can do this experiment in in a laboratory okay okay you keep reducing the air pressure boiling port keeps dropping it's a hard in 70 degrees 150 hundred twenty a hundred degrees Fahrenheit 80 degrees Fahrenheit fifty degrees Fahrenheit forty degrees Fahrenheit thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit holy shed what happens the ice melts and becomes water the water evaporates and becomes steam and all of that's happening at 32 degrees there is an atmospheric pressure for which water ice and steam coexist and it's called the triple point of water and all ingredients have a triple point Wow Mars Mars is very close to the triple point of water so you can have you can have a simultaneous bath in certain regions of Mars a simultaneous bath because the air pressure is so low is like one one-hundredth Earth's air pressure it's very very low so you know a place where a pot of water ice cubes and steam are coming out all at once it's at the triple point so so so here's the lesson here is we live life in our world at one atmospheric pressure at one the room temperature atmospheric pressure and we define what is normal based on that life experience based on how our senses interact with that environment but the actual universe is far freakier than what we that what our senses are exposed our five senses are exposed to on earth what did you think about Elon Musk's idea about nuking the poles of Mars in order to make it warmer yes so some of these are kind of pie in the sky ideas right but let's let's get to what he's trying to get at what you want to do is you want to introduce warmth you want to block the ozone you want to block the ultraviolet it's so that you can protect organic life all right so we have an ozone layer it's three oxygen atoms oh three and oxytocin likes ultraviolet light so ultraviolet light comes from the Sun and gets eaten by ozone it gets eaten and when you do that the ultraviolet light doesn't make it to Earth's surface so even though they sell where wears sunscreen and you've sunblock 45 yes that's for the 1% of the ultraviolet that gets through the atmosphere if you're above the atmosphere you are fried so the because ultraviolet is highly hostile to organic molecules and what we're made of as life so you want to protect you want to give life a chance so you want to not only heat Mars you want to find a way to block the ultraviolet light coming from the Sun so you need some mechanism if not ozone or it just live underground for example okay and so so I don't think we should think of the idea as a literal thing but just it's a general principle of what you want to accomplish on Mars in doing so you want to warm it you want to protect what could be the future of biochemistry and then you see it and you and then you wait you don't know wait too long you want to sort of speed it up if you could and then you terraform Mars SpaceX has I've visited him a couple of times he's he's got a mug you can buy there then it has Mars on it okay and then you put put hot liquid in it and Mars turns to an arable blue-green marble so yeah it's very good and it doesn't tell you that when you so I got a Mars mug you know and you show it off and oh my gosh what did that happen it's an earth mug but it doesn't look like Earth there's a lot of people that go on also we think there's a lot of water that was once on Mars which is a certainty and we think it's just sitting below in a permafrost so you wouldn't have to bring water to Mars by the way in the really distant future you can just redirect a comet and get all the water you need but how far distant is that the Comets everywhere dude we're in a shooting gallery yeah that's not what I asked oh do you think it is before we could read the ref our weight in time yes okay sorry we know how to do it but there's no real incentive so there's no engineering funded engineering plan to do it but we know how to do it on paper we know how to do it conceivable way oh yeah you so there so first of all it happens with or without us because we are in the shooting path of countless thousands of asteroids and comets so what you would do is you'd find one that's headed close to us anyway in the seventh orbit down the line or the hundredth orbit down the line and then you'd slightly deflect it in such a way that it would then collide with Mars or even earth if you wanted the earth needed some more fresh water yeah I heard that there's a possible but it ain't the problem is if something really big that would fill lakes worth if that collided with earth that would just be bad for life on earth because it's a spontaneous deposit of energy that can change the climate and do it so you want to do that on a planet that you're trying to terraform isn't that the speculation of how water got here in the first place so if the jury's still out on that there's there tags in the oceans in the water molecule that tell you that the water must have come from more than one source so that's what's confusing things we want it to be a simple thing it all came by comets or it all came from inside the earth through volcanoes volcanoes emit Lakes and historically lakes and oceans worth of water just out of there out of there calderas so so the problem is what as we say in science over determined there's plenty of comets to have delivered all the water there's plenty of water that could have come out of out of volcanoes to give us all the way so but in the oceans it's clearly a mixture and so the final word is still out on that what do you think about what's going on why now with the protesting of the building of this largest and latest telescope yes the the the TMT 30 meter telescope which would be you know the largest ever by far of any kind of telescope the history of astronomy is one where bigger telescopes become bigger buckets to collect light that's the only telescopes today are the same as telescopes when they were invented they're just bigger all right the principle behind them is bigger because what they're doing is simple all you're trying to do is get as much light as possible and the more light you get dimmer is the object you can detect and the farther away is the object you can see and so for every generation of new large telescopes that have been built it is it has increased and deepened our understanding of our place in the universe so that's just the that's the background the proposal is for a thirty meter telescope largest ever on the Big Island of Hawaii in Mauna Kea where there other telescopes there well that's where the Keck is right yeah I think if I it's where the Keck is I think they they sighted it in a place that sort of tucked behind most sight lines to it but that's not so much what's important here it's that the Native Hawaiians from what I've read view the mountain as a sacred place and so to put a telescope yet another telescope there becomes sort of invasion of sacred land and so so yeah it's it's it's a there's a standoff last I looked I mean people protesting in the streets and there's some Native Hawaiians who embrace this because it means jobs high high quality jobs engineering jobs he's got to build it got to maintain it there's an entire supportive infrastructure for that that means jobs and it's done in collaboration with the University of Hawaii and the all the other telescopes are partnered with the University of Hawaii where people are educated there and so so at the end of the day you have to ask well how are you going to make decisions going forward are you make them democratically then you take a vote or you do you want the natives to to be the deciders of their own fate and is that democratic okay so in the natives vote okay or is it the few people who are protesting do they win the day I mean it's it's complicated and it's very it's very there are a lot of nuanced issues going on there there's a there's a branch of thinking that the the United States government and and normal municipal leaders have no authority over it there's some who claim that this is native hawaiian property that does not belong to any municipal entity of the US government so therefore even state representatives have no say right so there's a lot going on there okay but if I were to weigh in this is how I would do so okay I would say first I think what should happen is I don't know if they even have the the infrastructure system is set up but if they could set it up this way if the mountain is viewed as sacred by the natives the natives should have entire say of what happens to the mountain okay that's how I think that should be so now what you want to make sure is that whatever decision gets made and voted upon by the natives that it's fully informed you are you don't want to vote being misinformed or under informed in any election let alone whether you're voting for a telescope on your sacred mountain okay otherwise you're voting out of nowhere right yeah you know you're influencing your future based on partial information and decisions based on partial information or bad decisions no matter what okay so I would say hold the vote with the natives and make sure everybody's fully informed and here's a bit of information I just want to add to the information okay you know what we do as astrophysicists we study the universe rather passively at that we sit there at the end of a telescope and wait for light to reach us it's not a petri dish where we stir it or heat it or freeze it or crack it or we're just kind of there communing with the cosmos my PhD thesis was significantly fed by data that I obtained from mountaintops at telescopes I got my data from mountains in Chile settar to Lola and it employed all the natives of the natives the local local people that's another telescope that so there's all these telescopes that all have specific access points to the universe they're not all asking the same questions right and so it's the collection of all the data that gives us the complete understanding what we think is a complete understanding of the universe so what we do is try to understand our place in the universe and all I'm gonna say is that if you have power over what happens on that mountain and it's sacred to you because whatever that is it is something important to you and your sense of your understanding of your place in this world that would be spiritual significance I can tell you that what we learn as astrophysicists from those mountaintops gives us a deeper understanding of who and what we are in this universe so I would say that whatever is your concept of God be it the creator of the universe the spirit energy that pervades all of space and time whatever is your concept the discoveries of astrophysicists bring you closer to it I get your perspective let me be the opposing view they feel well I'm not trying to no I know this is information I'm putting this is information and I walk out of the room and then you all vote right I'm not you know we believe in democracy here and majority rules that's it that's kind of a good thing it's kind of worked all right but if it's not majority rules I don't know how they're going to make decision but let's say invent a future where the natives vote if they vote I wanted to make sure they heard what I just said and and now take control of your own fate I just don't think they care I think they've decided that that's a sacred space and they don't want anybody doing anything to it then that's their decision them you think that's okay I know I don't I don't judge Peeples but if you wanted to make a convincing appeal to them know what I just told you that's it that is all I would tell them and when they vote I want them to understand that fact I could take it one step further and say mountaintops because of the access they give astrophysicists and and by-proxy us all to the universe our sacred places to scientist okay now it's not sacred in a religious sense but it's sacred in a in terms of a pathway to knowing and understanding who and what we are in this universe we place great value on that so but it's not our land that's with you know specifically these things have Europeans didn't come to Hawaii and find fine legions of scientists they're conducting experiments okay they found a t'v peoples governing themselves so so so that's that the consequence if it gets voted down and that's permanent and there's no way around that that telescope is still gonna be built it just won't be built in Hawaii well where will it be built there you have to be built on mountaintops yeah so there are the mountaintops an issue right yeah you want to be above you know somewhat see clouds and haze and and you want a dry environment so there's less rain I went to see what clouds you visited yeah very good the Keck more than ten years ago the first time and it was I got very fortunate it was a night where the moon was not out yes moon is not the astronomers favorite thing yeah you want the darkest sky you can we were worried as we were driving up there that was really cloudy but we drove through the clouds and got to the top and we got to the observatory and it was the most amazing without telescopes just we there was telescopes there but without telescopes it was the most amazing view of the sky I'd ever seen in my life and it changed my perspective of our place in the universe looked like you were on a spaceship like we were flying through the universe because of the diffuse lighting in on the big island because it's all set up so that it doesn't ruin what they're trying to accomplish at the CAC reflections in the wrong place not only that if there was a moon out and you did ascend up through the clouds the moonlight illuminates the clouds and you are an island in the middle of white cotton yeah and you're not even connected to the earth it's what you imagined Mount Olympus would have been I've been there for them when that happens with the gods up there and it's kind of that's their place it's there so so so yes and so any my my brethren my fellow astrophysicist who have also observed from mountaintops by the way it's becoming a lost art because it's not lost but it's becoming something we don't do anymore something called service observing will you put in your observing program and it's Hana to a technician at the telescope who points the telescope gets the data and sends it back to you so the next generation doesn't have the experience that my generation did because there was a pilgrimage to the top of the mountain and you converted your life's path you we converted your life schedule to become nocturnal and in so doing you you know this is the journey was long enough because you're in the middle of nowhere now you got to go nocturnal and by the time you're ready for this you are communing with the cosmos it is you the detector the telescope and the universe and there's an eerie silence up there too because you don't hear any the hum of maybe the the drop of the motor or of the telescope but that's it and so so all I'm saying is if they choose to not have it the tell us we'll go somewhere else one of them is the Canary Islands these are also volcanic hilltops not as high as as Mount aquella that's at 14,000 feet by the way I should have checked it what temperature water boils at the top amount of K we could have rounded that story out but I think it's around a hundred eighty degrees actually I think I did actually calculate it one time but anyhow so so you'd find a mountaintop and we'll put it somewhere else and the data won't be as good but that'll be a consequence of it and none of that'll go to Hawaii how do you think that's gonna get resolved though if you had to guess I don't know um I uh I just don't know a lot of people are against it including Jason Momoa Aquaman's against it Oh uh-huh who's out there protesting yeah and so when you get celebrity types to put the weight of their name behind it it it magnifies the cause of others even if they're in the minority yeah and so I like I said I think natives should has everyone know who all the natives are is it is there some listing so that they can all vote for this one thing you wouldn't want people voting who are not native if you're voting on whether it's so sacred you don't want to put a telescope there you'd want people who have a an indigenous an indigenous concern for what goes on there and indigenous in reference to Hawaii's relative every message of the word indigenous is relative yeah especially with Hawaii because the only indigenous people are black people in Africa because life human life began in Africa you everyone else traveled to where they were so so native its you set a timeframe to declare what is native and what's not yeah and a native and it's in its simplest form is are you born there so I'm a native New Yorker I'm born there but I wasn't the original settler there I would my species did not form on Manhattan Island so everybody traveled to where they are they just got there before the Europeans and so that has become the definition of indigenous all right were you there when the Europeans landed then you're indigenous but to other life-forms on that on that rock on that hawaii's are a volcanic it's a volcanic archipelago you know how that happens by the way you have all these multiple volcanoes in there sir and a string you ever wonder why how that happens so you did wonder what you did you know why oh because there's a hot spot beneath Earth's crust it's just sitting there okay and when you're beneath Earth's crust stuff doesn't move around the way it does on Earth's crust Earth's crust shifts okay so that hot spot gurgles up makes a volcano then the hot spot goes dormant but the cot that shelf still drifts you still have continental drift so it drifts then the hot spot says time for me to gurgle again it girls up now you get another volcano and then it goes dormant that volcano goes dormant it shifts you get another one any time you see an of Islands jet guarantee they're made by volcanoes over enough time for continental drift to have shifted the plates over the hot spot of Earth's mantle so do you think what they're concerned with is the eventual spoiling of this beautiful natural resource that slowly but surely people are putting up houses there and developments and all these different things and then the scientists are saying we need this sacred land because we're gonna put a volcano and they like look this is already this is already a I mean we're gonna put a telescope there's already a telescope up here enough you think that's what it is they're trying to halt the progress of civilization or I mean maybe progress is a bad word the expansion of civilization yeah I mean let's go back what did Teddy Roosevelt - he said we got to preserve these lands yeah because they're beautiful and by the way he said that after he shot all those elephants and tigers lions and tigers and bears yeah I mean I hail from a museum the American Museum of Natural History would where he's the patron saint of that museum what happened was he realizes how important this land is and how beautiful it is and he is the he's the patron saint of the National Park System so so that's the secular version of sacred right we don't say it's sacred but we've all decided as a community that we care about these lands and you don't want to drill on it you don't want to put housing was it Lyndon Johnson's wife Lady Bird Johnson who said our freeways that were so carefully building after the Second World War the Eisenhower freeway project okay you know the interstate system is this is our country we want to keep it beautiful so certain wretches over there are no billboards billboards would you know would change your relationship to nature so certain stretches of interstate or secularly sacred if I can say that so I remember visiting visiting Australia and there's the the famous rock in the out in the outback the police help me I get I get my correct pronunciation of this uluru and it said it's I'm told it's one coherent geologic rock it's not just an assembly of rocks and so I don't know enough about the geology of it but I do know that the Australian Aborigines uluru and ok iconic red rock look at that cool thing okay so that is one sort of geologic thing and and climbers want to climb it but that's heat its miles in circumference okay so we visited it I rented a bicycle with my wife and kids and we rode around it okay so now that is sacred to the local indigenous peoples so they don't want you to climb on it well I'm a rock climber right you know what do you care I'm not gonna ruin it I'm not gonna they don't want you to climb on it and I try to think to myself is there a counterpart to this that would sort of wake up a westerner to say I get it alright now suppose some people from so natives from Alaska or from the some tribes from Africa or some Aborigines came up from these remote places of the world walked up to the Vatican and said we want to climb the walls of this Vatican just for sport what would we say we want to climb the walls of st. Paul's Cathedral in downtown London what would you say no yeah but are those comprable maybe we want to down the tower of Big Ben you're gonna say no get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you would say no these are important structures to us no are you gonna say are the equivalent all we built those you know the natives didn't build the rock right exactly okay it depends on how important that detail is to you all I'm saying is on the level of weeks say this is sacred you say that is sacred and now you're gonna have different rules for who's climbing what I think it'll for to force you to take pause so here's an argument in full in like supporting what you're saying look at what's going on with the Himalayas I mean it's the human [\u00a0__\u00a0] that they had they leave behind their welcome I'm so disturbing yeah the climbers yeah it's horrible it's really horrible I mean they there's tons of it tons of human waste okay so what you do there is if it's still not a problem that people are climbing it's that they're leaving waste you don't stop the climbers you tax them at some level so then now you have cleanup crews that come up after them good so they're your own Taksim you make it worth it all right understand like they leave the bodies up there right you know that they can't that's what I heard that's what I heard well why do you think they can bring tons of [\u00a0__\u00a0] when they can't even bring bodies here's what I'm saying when they invented cars and cars were killing people in the street because people have known how to cross the street they don't know where to cross the street people don't know how to stop the cars they say well cars are actually a pretty useful thing do we ban cars no we make stoplights oh people across our will we make crosswalks oh let's put lanes so the cars don't hit each other and and let's make airbags so that you don't fly through the windshield alright so there are ways around problems if you value the thing that it is that you want to do so if people even crap up there you make them bring it back or you develop a system that enables the stuff to come back no matter what and if you can't do that you don't want it messed up then cancel the whole operation we didn't cancel cars we got really innovative about having kids difference between cars and human [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's left in the side of the mountain I think the real problem too is I think if you value mountain climbing and you want to keep doing it then you've solved the problem this is what engineers do that's all they do right because what's your problem solve it being able to bring those bodies back because the physical limitations of the human body it's barely you barely have enough juice to climb it's so thin the air so thin it's so dangerous and the energy draw on you is so long leave those bodies there was that the human ship that you're talking about or Zell there's no you're talking about the fact that humans were there that we got we were not very clean about our presence that's what you're talking about well we're just being human we have to go and you got to go you got to go when we got to go up there you just open up the hatch and let it rip down the side of a mountain and the resulting you know in the space station they recycle your urine and your then your crap congratulations to them yeah because that put engineers on the problem I mean my cycle it they extract all the water from it and then what's left is highly dried and he joined in a role yeah yeah water is water its water molecule that's the thing about by the way every graph you see this people's pee is in it that's correct yeah so you got about a bottle of water here hey vampy okay this has Napoleon's penis yes yes there are more molecules of water in this bottle then there are bottles of water this volume of order in all the world's oceans so in other words if you drank this and peed it out okay you have enough molecules in european-- your sweat and then in the the moisture that you exhale all that goes back into the environment scattering into all sources water of the world and there's enough of those molecules to occupy every half liter of water that that covers the surface of this earth so that given enough time you scoop a cup of water out of there I don't even care if you filter it the h2o is still there that is water that has passed through the kidneys of Abraham Lincoln Genghis Khan mm-hmm Joan of Arc hey Socrates Plato no Jesus can I get a bottle of geez I'm trying to get my Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure at list going here okay you just ruined it but yes Jesus would be included in that so would Socrates yes so that is the scent by the way the same is true with breath of air there are more molecules of air in every breath you take then there are breaths of air in all the atmosphere of the earth so when you exhale there's enough of those molecules to scatter and the the the air currents will do this to scatter into every breath of air that is inhale so when you take a breath of air you have molecules of air that went through the lungs of Jesus we're all connected and there's no way around it and the water that we have is the water that we have right we drink it we pee it yeah because the atmosphere comes down as rain yeah and the rain is the an important difference is a lot most of the water on Earth is salt water that you can't drink there's a limited amount that's fresh water how much of a by the way all the glaciers are freshwater because that's it's frozen rain right frozen rain here's something that no one talks about when the glaciers melt where does the water go where's it go just tell me you know the answer just back in the ocean okay so but this is now non salty water going into the ocean so you're mixing fresh water with brackish water and they occupy different places in the vertical profile of the ocean and because salt water is heavier than fresh water so the freshwater occupies the top right that's not as salty as the water at the blow and there are circulations in the ocean not only up and down you know northern latitude southern latitude like the Gulf Stream there's also circulation top to bottom and the combinations of all these circulations create the stability of the ocean if you disrupt that oh my gosh there are animals fishes that can't live anymore where they to be because the salt level is different and so some animals might go extinct some weather patterns will change because the ocean affects climate so these are this is why climate modeling is so critical yet so complicated is because a lot of variables that show up why can't we take the salt out of the water you can it just takes energy you can do but why isn't that been being Donna you can't you have to ask you who's paying for the energy where you getting the energy from it's an energy thing but I would think that would be very valuable I mean think about how many people it's not valuable enough yet that's the point well is it that it's it's just money dude it's just money you can ask what does it cost to ship a bah half pint of water from Fiji ok whatever hell is the square bottle that you buy in a Fiji water is it Fiji right yeah Fiji water what does it cost to to bottle that in Fiji ship it here relative to desalinating the ocean it's cheaper to ship to Fiji there'll be a day when that's not the case and future Wars are gonna be fought over who has access to fresh water and the value of water will go up and by the way the value of water in space is ten thousand dollars a pound so if you if you last sue a comet and you say this is a lot of fresh water yeah you could I guess you can bring it back down to earth but that's expensive you're better off selling it to NASA for nine thousand dollars a pound because it costs them ten thousand dollars a pound to put water into orbit so you better off keeping it up there and somehow or another yeah and so if you--if you harness water in space you're better off trading in space with it then bringing it back down to a planetary surface at the moment the economics favor that what is the desalination process so it's it's simply you just evaporate the water it's basically a still it's it's it's it's a it's a distillery right so here's here's a pocket of water with this highly salty and you just heat it the h2o evaporates leaving sodium chloride behind and at the end you get this salt deposit at the bottom of your dish at the bottom of your vessel oh wait a minute what happens to lakes that used to be there that salty lakes that used to be there that aren't there's a salt deposit that's the source of our modern-day salt this is why tweeted the other day an all table salt is is all table salt is sea salt it just came from long buried prehistoric evaporated seas so salt mines and and I was I was told by some geologists III had had a narrow and narrow usage of the word mine I think if a mine I think of a hole in the ground but mining operations includes surface operations as well so there's surface Lakes that that have evaporated and you get salt from that as well as the mines that you would dig down deep below so that hole all of that is a mining operation my tweet only referenced the Buried ones but it's all but it's all from evaporated waters it's all from evaporated it's all sea salt is the point now nuclear power plants rely on steam right isn't that part just just to finish the point so you evaporate the water and the salt left maybe you might want to use that make some sea salt out of it table salt and that evaporated water condenses out over here and that is distilled water now you might want to mineralize it so it tastes good because distilled water doesn't taste good plus it's not really healthy to drink it as you probably know you drink distilled water it goes into equilibrium with your minerals sucking minerals out of you so it has the same minerality that your body does and then you pee it out and you'll systematically drain yourself of important electrolytes yeah so generally the water that you would say tastes good and you enjoy has some mineral bits some some some kind of mineral minerals in it now nuclear power plants don't they the process is using that nuclear energy to create steam to operate turbines and yeah basically all of our electricity that comes from essentially the mostly electricity is coming from turbines that convert steam to electricity so it's oh sorry so you heat water the water makes steam the steam turns the turbine and the earning turbine generates the electricity so so you it's it's a matter of where do you get the energy to boil the water that's what it comes down is it call is it oil is it is it nukes is it wind is a hydro all of this if you get a hydro plant oh by the way then a hydro plant they don't have to make steam because they have the water the water pressure at the base of the dam moves through the turbines that turns the turbines and they make electricity so you don't have to heat anything because they have the water pressure to do that anyway that is also solar power by the way because the Sun evaporated ocean water the water lifts up becomes a cloud the cloud moves over ground over the land the cloud rains into the lake that is above the dam so the energy that got the water up there in the first place is all solar so you should think of hydroelectric as solar as well as wind energy because wind is the uneven an equal heating of air on Earth's surface and that creates air currents that's also solar power there's also this also work isn't it conceivable that you could come up with a combination of desalination and power plant where you're using the heat to combine you know to make the turbines move and then you steam it off and that's where you get the water from that would be a good that's an interesting idea and I don't know how much that's been thought about what you're saying is I'm making steam anyway yeah so why don't I do it suck with salt water out yeah yeah and make that's a nice two for one kind of thing three for one you get salt and salt out the other side yes salt gets all you fresh water get fresh water and you generate electricity yeah so do patent it no it's free for anybody wants it no take that run with it I have high hopes for tidal energy because there's certain places on earth where tides are very powerful and they're very and you just put some paddles in there and you sort of and it and it works both ways when the water comes in and out no this is battery technology that's the reason why la isn't completely dependent upon solar because it seems like this is the spot to do it like it never rains I mean if it rains here 50 days yeah it's crazy or any desert right and we're you would next door to the Mojave Desert right so so one of the problems is by the way the deserts are generally localized to certain latitudes on earth it's because of general circulation on earth so the air pockets on earth there's a lot going on earth air moves in a lot of ways but there's a there's an overriding circulation of air that has air sort of rising up at the equator imagine a cylindrical movement of air that that that Gerdes the earth okay so just above the equator you have a cylinder rotating where you have air rising and just below the equator you have a cylinder rotating the opposite wave so that air is still rising at the equator okay so it rises at the equator its unstable it makes clouds the equators one is the cloudiest place on earth practically one of the cloudiest places well how about the other side of those cylinders where the air descends okay okay when you have descending air you don't make clouds well how big is the cylinder it's about thirty degrees of latitude wide so your rainiest places on earth are at the equator that's where you get the Amazon rainforest in the lake and your driest places on earth or at 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south because these cylindrical movements of air have descending air there so the Mojave Desert the Sahara Desert the Gobi Desert they're all around 30 degrees north latitude so this so we live on the surface of the earth where there are forces operating that are so much bigger than us that we would not even think about it why is an India would be a desert because it's right in that zone we're it not for the seasonal monsoons it doesn't rain much in India except when it's monsoon season so the monsoon is sort of the exception what would otherwise happen there and that's why everyone loves the monsoon and they hate it but they love it it cools the whether they get sources water there it is so they ask you the question again okay not answered sorry oh so so so battery technology like what why isn't LA completely solar it should be it's not that some of it is cost la is so car heavy all right and plus you know there's a Lamborghini passing me at 20 miles an hour on the 405 that this is the the land of wasted horsepower right so any place that has a lot of sunlight should be thriving on solar panels and you guys aren't I looked around very few how very few homes have solar panels and I don't fully understand that you could if you did that then you'd run your own run off your own power you can do this yeah you can do the equation difficult by the way and so so yeah I mean the price might have to come down a little further you don't really see the full price of oil it's it's subsidized in ways that are not obvious to us you know we built the roads with our taxes so that car companies could sell you a car that you drove on the road that they that was built for them if they have to build all their own roads the price of gas to go in the car would have been much higher the price of your car would have been that all that would have been much higher if the car companies do it what I'm saying is I make a product and I want you to use it but there's no roads oh I convinced you to build the road so you can buy my car and drive on that road that's a weird way of looking at it but in some ways it's it's full cost accounting it's full cost accounting what is the cost of coal it's how many people died of lung disease of new mono ultra-microscopic silica volcano County OSIS okay that's the longest word in the in the Random House dictionary yeah that's basically black yes basically black line you can break it up the new mono ultra-microscopic silikov Oh with the silicates in can Akane OSIS so there's all medical bits except stapled together to make that word so so what is the cost to their health their death the air quality asthma the total cost of oil is not what you pay at the gas tank it's other things that we shell out that are not realized in the actual cost of that source of energy if you full cost accounted what all this really costs then the solar option would look way better than it does relative to it that's all I'm telling but when you're talking about cars and car manufacturers having to pay for roads isn't that they didn't say once isn't that like restaurants having to pay for toilet paper no restaurants going restaurants have to pay for land that you would park your car on to go into the restaurant not in New York City but in places where everybody has cars you don't have valet parking I my restaurant will not occupy the entire plot of land I just bought it's gonna be something's gonna be 1/4 of that land and all the rests are gonna be parking spots I have absorbed the cost of your parking your car in me in my acquisition of that of that real estate for example to make it convenient so people could use your facility correct so right but I bore that cost as as restaurateur right or maybe I'm renting of course but that's that's it does not relate to someone the car manufacturer is being forced to pay for the roads or that they should be that would have been interesting had they because then it would have changed the pricing of everything but why would they be are you gonna make a car no one has a road to drive it on it's what it's your responsibility then you don't have a business but don't you want a car yes so we all agree cars are good they move fast they get you where you want to go right so how do we as society make it easier for people to get where they want to go well we all chip in and we make roads it's not entirely - before there were cars a car nobody is sneaking you know I want to go to Chicago tomorrow and I'll be back on Thursday no one is even having that thought before they were email no one's thinking and right these are not thoughts so I'm just talking about all the forces that had to align to make it actually work okay so now what's holding back electric cars well I might not be able to charge it it takes a little too long to charge compared to my other vehicle are there enough chargers along the way well these were questions that were asked when people got cars five cars and it takes guess is there a gas station Oh Standard Oil says we'll put a gas station there because you're buying cars and so it's a whole family of businesses coming together and you're paying for a big part of that it's not just the car you paid for the roads that's all I'm saying I'm not complaining about it I'm just describing it as a reality I get it I just didn't understand the the comparison to car manufacturers paying for the days if I make a car and I want you to buy my car I need a road so I'm gonna build the road oh wait a minute I convinced you to build a road that's even better oh my gosh I made it a national priority oh it's a security problem we need a we need a military design interstate system that's what the interstates its military that's why it goes through mountains instead of over them that's why there long stretches of straightaway so you can land an airplane on it that's why they're built above the road that's where the surface roads are not the same thing as highways because the highways are not on the surface why cuz they built up why because tanks can drive on him without decomposing the road what specs did we put this to to the Autobahn the Germans invented the modern highway system they invented the cloverleaf they invented the off ramps they invented all of that and their armies could move on their roads like it was nobody's business and Eisenhower said hey we might get me some of that he comes back that's probably not how he said it I'm guessing but he comes out convinces us all that we need to build an internist I got nothing against the interstate system I'm just giving you the foundational facts for it and by the way the interstate system costs as much as going to the moon about a hundred billion dollars in total cost seems like a bargain compared to how many people use it versus the moon and it grows the economy that has a lot of a lot of but basically it was sold as a security need because if you're at war you need to move material and personnel and you might have to land an airplane in an emergency way and so all freeways do this you're gonna crash the plane do it on a freeway happens yeah but do it because you might land safely and if you don't land safely the road comes to you to get to the hospital don't crash in a forest we can't get to you right I can't get emergency vehicles good call yeah you know have you seen this new Porsche has a new electric vehicle there's about to release and I haven't seen a solution airy groundbreaking technologies charge much faster you could charge up to 80% in 20 minutes because it's double the well pull up the information was it wattage or amperage well what just just a couple of things that's different battery you can't cheat physics so so yes some batteries charge faster than others but what's what really drives the charging speed of battery is the is the voltage over which you charge the battery and it goes as the square of the voltage so super charge so if you charge a an electric car in your 120 volt home electricity it could take 30 hours if you go to 240 volts okay it'll take you know 10 hours if you go to 384 volts so you keep going up that drops precipitously and you can get a voltage where the thing will charge in a few a couple hours yeah we have a supercharger here oh he's only yeah yes I'm set up here for my Tesla so there you go which specially asked quickly yes yes yeah cool yeah so your charge in it in at most 90 minutes I don't think they call it that anymore I think they own them the superchargers no there's the the Tesla I think they call it a they have like an S raven they have difficulty s anymore no it's not the P 100 D that's the that's the heart they don't battery capacity okay now they I think they have it based on whether it's a single engine or a double engine they've simplified things the guys have removed all the labels to make it a little slicker sewed in the Porsche is it just they're selling a higher voltage charger to you or is that is the battery so completely different Google ten interesting things about the new Porsche Tyco can how do you say it I can that's the articles reading today mhm that's cool so my concern is batteries are still kind of 19th century technology yeah you know invented the battery Volta Alexandre Volta Wow that makes it's cool yeah voltage vowel is volts come from him well yeah yeah all these guys got you know they got famous so Tesla we got a car named after him the guy had a nose a car there's actually a unit of electromagnetism named after Nikola Tesla yeah it's Webber's per square meter I think so it's a it's like the the density of magnetic field strength within a certain area through through a surface so Betty she charged by an inductive plate the eventual trusted Porsche claims that the Porsche Turbo charging system charges at 300 15,000 watch kilowatts 15 minutes 80% in just 15 minutes oh that's cool it's not clear how they will prevent battery overheating maybe they want good luck so it could be vaporware but we'll see but what but it's game on that's what that means yeah it's game on whether it works or not it's like people Tesla is on notice everybody's on notice yeah oh my gosh I'm gonna lose market share because people want to buy an electric car and so you didn't want something that's gonna charge fast and that's the number one complaint that most people have over electric cars where you find a way to okay so that's one way but another way is you find a way to swap batteries as quickly as it in less time that it takes to fill a tank yeah you know how much time do you stand there with your hand on the nozzle waiting for the gas to go in alright so they would have to have a mountain of battery sitting there waiting for people to just come in is that any worse than a mountain that then at dinner then a sunken reservoir tank of gas there's no different why is that any different probably larger volume right possibly but so what if it's economic you just do it right and if the battery is all at the bottom of the car and it's going NASCAR you run in pop it up take out the battery / that's when you're off do you think that's the future why not that's better than charging the battery you don't have a car do you no I do as a yeah I do have cars now I didn't used to I didn't used to expensive his help to garage it in New York they just went up the price just went up the big the big a price point of that was when did the average cost to garage a car for a month in New York in Manhattan equal the average cost of a two-bedroom home in the United States and we've passed that cost of rent yes yeah of course Lord sir it was like some 600 a month or something - ran a parking spot you rent a parking spot right one spot one spot I'm a sonnet number month and you can rent the home in many places in the suburbs somewhere for 600 so I now have a Tesla yeah so I own it up they're expensive by the way sorry yes I have the X so that's my utility vehicle the X is the SUV a very high acceleration as you know and but yeah there's there's no maintenance on it right there's no oil change there's no you know the only moving part is the what you turn in the wheels with right there no Pistons nothing so you know cars really should have been this 100 years ago and then we would have had a hundred years of clever engineering to perfect that you ever see the documentary who killed the electric car you know I haven't but I know about it and I know some of the background story behind it and the electric car was one of the first concern because electricity was all the rage a hundred years ago let's electrify the cities this days Edison there's tests everybody wants to do everything electric and the car had just come out let's do it electric so this was not a new concept and it's unfortunate that more sort of innovative thinkers hadn't been brought to task on how to perfect the electric car speaking of Tesla electricity what did you think about Tesla's initial idea that Westinghouse shot down to sort of broadcast electricity so that people could just pull it out of the air yes so the the people in the nikola tesla fan club somehow feel that he got wronged in his life okay and surely some of that is true with regard to his business acumen and patents and and who owns the patent and who does does he have good business sense is he as savvy or as as sneaky whatever other words you might apply to Edison all right so I get that but his contributions to electromagnetism are real and recognized in the world of physics like I said there's a unit of electromagnetism named after him so don't come crying to me say he was not recognized by my people okay he's recognized he had some ideas that were a little out there and out there on a level where it almost certainly would have not worked and here's why okay electromagnetic energy is communicating between us I see you that's because visible light is reflecting off of your scalp okay to me it's reflecting off of my nose back to you you can ask how much energy is in that well not much it's not much energy in a visible light photons if you stayed there long enough you might feel a little warmth from it but no you're not gonna drive a car with that energy you're not gonna run a motor with it okay well of what good is it oh you know what we found we can use electromagnetic radio waves which are the lowest form of electromagnetic energy lowest energy level of all of your life we can straight away it's not to transmit energy that's not the point of it the point is to transmit information and information became what characterized the modern era and that's why in the 1950s and 60s when everyone is imagining flying cars and motorized sidewalks everything is running on energy because they're thinking energy is going to be free in the future but what they didn't figure was that information would be free or easy to transmit and to generate and to store and to to delete and whereas the the energy that would take to move things and to drive things that would be a problem no one saw that coming nobody saw that coming so as your photons get higher and higher energy yes you can start doing things with them you get x-rays and gamma-rays but that's not what Tesla was referring to he was talk about moving radio waves through the space that would charge things up you can't pack sufficient energy in your radio wave to do anything we need to do mechanically currently current well back then would it be sufficient it might have been something you could have done with your radio waves cuz the needs were no but no snow I take that back that was the height of the industrial revolution that was the age of the Machine the age of the giant turbines radio energy is not touching that well but wasn't it possible that he was considering it for things like radios or light bulbs or household items would it be possible to use that power for that so now what so what happens so the radio waves if you had enough power in radio waves to generate a light bulb to power a light bulb well through the air are you standing in the way of this this energy has pathways we now send energy through wires because you're not standing in the way of the wire the wire is buried the wire has insulation suspension you want to move it through the air and you want to walk around like no that's not how that works but what I've heard if you're moving inner energy through the air to power something that itself could kill you the energy powering through that moving through the air could kill you unless you you bring a little bit amount and then you store it and then use it later you could do it that way sure so we're sort of batteries yes you need a storage system but you would still probably have some sort of residual effect of having this stuff broadcast through the air and who knows what I would do to human health if you needed that much energy right now the energy to transmit information is so low that it no it has no effect on your health that's why I can pull out my cell phone I'm in a brick whether this is fake brick that's fake brick I made up bills real brick that no it's nice it is go touch it I don't believe you good was it rough bricks go touch the bricks man Jesus Christ he thinks we got fake bricks who do you think we are okay you guys thought I was a liar cut weird now let me be on there so it's a veneer a brick veneer okay the whole thing real building so it's not structural bread slice the end of bricks and then they mortar and everything okay so so we're both right we'll bring it but it's not structural this real fabric so here I am a real fake so we're inside I can pull out my cell phone and have a phone call yes these are microwaves of a frequency that can penetrate walls send information to my cell phone and I can communicate using information and not have that energy kill me but it's not enough to power the actual it is not enough to power the device correct so until us everyone is thinking he's got the solution to the future transmission of energy no he doesn't well I don't think anyone saying that but what he did and his fans do but back then there were no computers back there were no television but we did have machines it was the era of the big machine right but I don't think he was insinuating that you could use I don't know what he wanted to power with it I don't know what he would have powered with it if not light bulbs and other things you know one thing you brought up that's really interesting you talked about light reflecting off of things are you aware that BMW painted a they painted one of their cars vantablack I saw this is the jet black yeah yes I saw my soul and recently black yes so light can bounce off of it so not only can't drive it because people won't be able to see it at night Oh literally saying like this is just the theoretical you want to you can line it with with the triage of it cuz I'm sure I saw one in a parking lot it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's very bad I saw one in real life it's that's not what I saw I saw a sports car purchase vantablack car they have I saw a sports car that was it was not this the car you have up there I don't know what that is what I saw a BMW that they painted vantablack okay well then that mess is black is available I'm on their badass low to the ground sports car and so what no it's not available commercially what do you want me saying so I'm saying that for BMW it's not it's not something they're off I'm in LA you have all your cars here anything that is everything showcased here what I didn't see it in New York I saw it here in LA well I'm sure or so maybe wasn't BMW maybe somebody else did and I'm just saying BMW if someone did it BMW didn't make it themselves okay someone must have done I mean you can do it it's a real thing vantablack okay so one of the principles of stealth is that if you send a signal to it it never comes back to you so you have no sort of radar measures its existence correct but there are two ways you can do that one of them is you cannot reflect back okay but so by absorbing it right okay so jet matte black will absorb it and not reflect it back but if there's enough energy coming at it it will heat up because you can't get something for nothing here it'll heat up the skin of that and it could be bad for the occupants that's what they said about the art the art will no Manta but if you put that in the desert forget it well they were saying even in Los Angeles where are so hot exactly so another way to do it is this signal comes to me and I reflect it in a direction that is not back to you so the b-2 bomber is not only non reflective back to you it takes the signal and reflects it and double bounces it so that all of your energy gets sent in other directions and not back to you so it doesn't then keep the energy that was sent to it so that's another way to do it another there's another stealth which was featured in one of the recent not recent four years ago James Bond movies where light that comes at it the light that's behind it goes around it coherently and continues to come towards you so that you think you're seeing what's behind it and it's not there you are seeing what's behind it but the path of that light went around the vessel and continue it on its way to you so you think you're just seeing the grass in the tree but there's a car sitting right there you don't know about this technology no yeah right now it exists only for very look up stealth light ray stealth so the material has to be able to know what is behind it you saying small objects only so no no only with it that only works in one sight line whereas if you needed functional stealth everybody looking at it should every path every sight line to it should be able to see what's behind it on the other side of that so the way it reflects things yeah yeah it's it carries the light beam around it and sends it out the other side you able to find yeah yeah what you have is this look like a solid block and a person is looking at it and you see their eye out the other side it's really freaky it's a future of stealth what are your thoughts on digital privacy what what do you mean well like phones yeah like phones like did you ever talk to someone about something and then you see it in your Google feed do you see ads oh yeah so we don't I mean I haven't researched this but my wife tells me we were once gifted one of these you know what do you call those things did you talk to oh yeah whatever the Google one is is that Alexa no alexis is Amazon right so it's Google at home and she said don't turn that on I said why not because it'll be listening and I didn't believe her at first and then I started hearing stories and so so I don't have one but it's not because I know that it's listening or not well substantiated there's mean actual we've said they've apologized for actual human contractors listening in to conversations that people have had having sex mm-hmm having arguments like it's real yeah I that seems like it should be a problem so what's your question to me what am i all for it or my Oh what what's your question no but the question is one of the things that you're getting out of their ability to scan things is they're tailoring things to your liking like you know a phone tells you it's 22 minutes until you get home I get it you're like [\u00a0__\u00a0] how do you know where I live exactly I didn't tell you where I live I got here it is and I'm just old-fashioned about this okay I'm get off my lawn about this yeah I'm the old man in the rocking chair on the porch saying go Sonny get off my lawn but you're also scientist okay but I don't want to okay I wear multiple hats I'm also a dad I'm also a husband I got all these hats for all those things in this particular case I'm old man and my old man sensibility is if you track what I shop at a store what would I buy at a store and then send me coupons based on what you think I'm gonna buy next based on what I've bought before which is kind of the same thing you're describing you have denied me the chance of stumbling upon something that I never thought of buying and that takes away my freedoms and I don't want that however they denied you the chance of stumbling upon something different it's not diabolical it's just in the casual flow of life I'll give an example I walk into a wine shop hey can I help you and I say if you help me find what I'm looking for it's a guarantee that I will never find what I'm not looking for and I'll end up spending less money in your wine shop that's a weird way look it's the art of browsing dude you're old enough to remember when I got to look up this word in a dictionary and you get through six other words whoa I never knew that weird let me read that you learn other words on route to the word you're targeting I understand okay listen that is how I feel and that's how I think about my interaction with this world I'd like the randomness the randomness of it enriches my life and if you're gonna advertise to me because you think you know who I am maybe you do but I'll ultimately end up spending less money because it's the diversity of how I think and what I buy and what I think of buying and how I buy it and how much money I spend that is the richness of the life I lead your truck you're trying to channel me into some product so some something that fulfills a what I call it when they have the the study whether you're gonna buy something or not there no no the the table of people do you like this product or not focus group yeah yeah am I just a focus group to you if I am you don't know me and I want to experience this world by stepping where I've never stepped before and buying something I've never thought of buying and if you know my previous habits you're assuming I'm gonna stay that way for the rest of my life and maybe most people do and maybe I might do that but if I do is because I chose to not because you have decided that that's how I should be well don't you think the stream is jump sorry sorry don't you think they're just doing that because they think it would be effective to advertise in that way so if you go googling new Nikes and then as you're looking at something in the Google ad pops up and it's for new Nikes they said hey Neal I know you were looking at the resource we saw maybe just need a little nudge I mean it's not I don't think that's that diabolical I I'm the old man on the porch I'm saying the next generation might feel completely different they might say I love it they know exactly what I want you heard about the case where they were that I read this I haven't Rivera fide it but it's completely plausible there was a teenage girl who was googling pregnancy tests cuz maybe she got pregnant okay and the fact that she had searched pregnancy test she got coupons in the mail for baby products and a parent said what is the blood what is this she got outed that's a little weird yeah but it's the kind of thing that can happen that seems that seems intrusive certainly because pregnancy it's enjoyable in every way no don't tell me it's not intrusive because you want to be seen you physical things there's not just something that appears on your google feed that you can cook a glance over what's the difference we can send you mail to your mailbox and filling your advertising space in front of your face with product what's the one other people can see it I've walked by your computer I can see it don't look I guess I'm arguing in principle rather than in detail okay well let me take the counterpoint in the on the positive side what they're doing in terms of particularly Google in terms of your driving right and in terms of using of Google Maps and documenting the history of all these people driving and especially with things like Waze which they acquired as they've developed a much more efficient product than Apple which what Apple does the Apple maps they shred everything you do yes they do they do they all where you've been and where you're going that's correct but Apple Maps sucks so you have to because they don't have enough data they don't have nearly the amount of data Google has Billy what is Google giving you that Apple Maps isn't they're telling you you're 22 minutes from home you're time for you to drive home what's valuing that well yes and also okay map wait hold on their programs far better I can ask it how long it'll take me to go somewhere rather than it knowing what my drop what my day time schedule looks like and then coming in like you said how do you know [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know I had that same reaction as you did and I said I wonder why what's causing this it's a little creepy and again I'm the old man syndrome some a 10 year old kid that's only ever known this and becomes 15 and 20 that is life to them right why would they even maybe they're not going to complain about it but I'm the old man on the porch but yet I'm saying it off my loss sort of intrusiveness or at the very least this connection that you have to these devices and that they have to your patterns and your information it seems inevitable that doesn't mean I have to welcome it with open arms but I agree it's inevitable I agree plus we have security cameras everywhere everybody knows where you are if the KGB had access to people the way we'd in that during the Cold War the way modern the United States has access to us we would say oh my gosh you have taken away your country's freedoms where the free leaders of the free world and you guys have imprisoned your entire population oh my gosh the KGB would give their right arm to have the monitoring devices that are actively in praat place here in the United States today mmm we know where you are we know how long you stayed there we have records of it we know what street you were walking on we don't necessarily monitor it but we can dig it up if we have to and with facial recognition I can track you wherever you are you use the facial recognition I use it now it doesn't care if I'm wearing if I'm wearing a hat or sunglasses it still knows who the hell I am yeah it relies on so many points yeah so many points of cheekbones and nose I separate and everything I think ratios of numbers are highly powerful probes of the structure in the form of things just so you know the Fibonacci sequence right that could be in there if you have a Fibonacci head I think it's a little overplayed Fibonacci's a little overplayed especially once you get a nose job you can find it in nature and say oh isn't this beautiful but you've overlooked all the places where it doesn't show up in nature so many times it it doesn't appear in more places than it does appear right but in a lot of living things you're living since before he cones yeah pineapples there's a lot of sunflower seeds it's very or sunflower flowers yeah yeah really weird isn't it yeah I mean it's just this random not random but this well if the next thing you do depends on the previous two things you did you get the Fibonacci series I mean that's often the case with say you know think of things in your life you do where the third thing you do depends on you having done the previous two things in this exactly the same way that's not everything in your life but you can surely find some things that do that mmm I think it was Camden New Jersey where they had such a crime that's such that was so random no it's not yeah Camden New Jersey had such a crisis of funding that I think there was a brief period of time at least I don't know if it's changed where they literally didn't have for us and one of their solutions was to put surveillance cameras everywhere and the idea was to sort of try to capture all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] that was going down here it is this is surveillance city of Camden New Jersey okay here's a guy crime and the intrusive tools they're using in hopes of stopping it right yeah this was I mean I don't remember this is after this happening it's let me take away your freedoms for your own safety hmm yeah this is this is a well known you know Benjamin Franklin wrote about it was his famous Benjamin Franklin quote about security and freedom yeah who abandons freedom security is getting neither or something yeah yeah so so this is not it yeah they that can give up Essential Liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety those who sacrifice Liberty for safety for security deserve neither he who would trade Liberty for some temporary security deserves neither Liberty that he's got all combination all permutations on that one this is so I mean I don't wanna leave any room for misquoting he understood that so your your security you give up some security for privacy I think yes and I don't know it's a well-known place where that should be drawn and you can actually get an entire generation born into a state where they think that's normal we all now think it's normal you have to show ID to walk into an office building oh my gosh what would that look like during the Cold War you have to show you in the United States you have to show your papers just to walk into a building well they're also changing oh my gosh system where if you don't want to travel with a passport you're gonna have to have a new 40 been through then a federal driver's license federally endorsed driver's license I just went through that last week yeah right so when did you go into play when is that going ah um it's for everybody like next year or something it's very soon if you want to travel in a particular way if you don't drive and then it doesn't matter fly right we want to fly correct correct and I carry my passport wherever I go so it's not really a problem for me but so carry your passport everywhere you go if you want to just jet out of the country how is your brain wired would escape no if I had four passports then you'd say do I want to leave the country yeah whoever that anybody in a you know espionage movie there's somebody who has five passports in a safes and with with wads of cash of every currency so so I think I worry that we're sliding towards a state of total monitoring on the premise that we're all better off for it right and it's like the frog in the heated water we don't feel it day by day but it's happening we all agree that we can be hand patted down just to get on an airplane we've all accepted that because of a handful of people a handful look at historically handful historically handful not even a handful in this moment just historically and fill the people we all say yes take my luggage x-ray my luggage take away my liquids Pat me down and I'm okay with that well that's a transition and I'm okay with security cameras in the street it was okay in banks we understood that but now when I exit the bank and I'm in the street when I'm walking and walking in the park so I don't know I don't know the future of that I really don't know I saw the movie 1984 recently not a very good movie the book is better than the movie and I hate to be the one of the people who say that but I was reminded how you can create an entire state where everyone is kept in line because somebody is telling you we are fighting this battle out on the front lines I'd forgotten this from the book they're fighting a war on the front lines you never see the war you never hear about the war you know anything about the war other than it exists and you have to do things a certain way in country so that your country can protect itself from these evil people that want to take over and destroy your way of life so everybody's under control from Big Brother well what they didn't anticipate though was these social media companies would be the guards or the gatekeepers of your privacy because that's what's interesting is it could you voluntarily give them all your information that's not government's rights it's Twitter and Facebook Google and you know all the stuff that we use on a daily basis that is access to everything that you do it's almost inconceivable to someone outside of this generation that there would be a company that would provide a service and through that service you would give up all notions of privacy all privacy yeah because literally you have a microphone that's listening everywhere you go you have a bug right there you can around with you I mean I don't remember yeah you've been you've been pin bucked right yeah really is you've been weakened with a lapel you will get ads for things you talked about I mean that has been proven hmm so what is that what is these passive listening devices they're only picking up key words it's no big deal it's just key word it's the frog in the water that's I'm telling you yeah so I don't know what's gonna go like I said I'm a little old folk old fogey about that but I think we'll resolve it do you think they should be regulation generally if you have something good and it gets abused you regulated that's the whole point of rape that's we're here alive today because of regulation because there are nefarious people who in control of powerful forces operating on society would gain at the expense of everyone else and would not be good for the progress of civilization so you regulate okay airlines are regulated so that you don't die all right what we have the safest record now ever for commercial airlines American carriers the safest ever look at look at not only how many people have not died relative to when we grew up we grew up through at least one or two planes crashed each year you'd lose between 1 and 300 people every year that was like the baseline number that number is near zero now and way more planes are taking off and landing that in anytime when we were kids so it's a double it's a double Progress point for not only the Transportation Safety Administration but engineering technology and everything we care about we want to fly so you regulate you make sure these are inspected this often you don't the pilots don't fly more than this many hours you this gets oiled this gets replaced it's one of the triumphs of modern engineering aerodynamics aerospace engineering as a branch of what we do as civilization is one of the greatest achievements there ever was agreed Jamie did you find that stealth stuff I found there are cars that have this wouldn't be a car this would be a laboratory the laboratory find anything okay oh look at a laboratory stealth light Oh something try that like cloaks that people wear that sort of seems like video yeah but in Harry Potter the the was the cloak that they wear the invisibility cloak that would be this principle yeah if it existed it with that there's a bunch of videos of that but it seems like they're just using After Effects like Adobe or something like that to death [\u00a0__\u00a0] with the video rather than create an actual product that's because there was a woman in an office that had a blanket and she held up the blanket and you could only see the whole office you wouldn't see the blanket at all you'd see what's behind her she lowered the blanket you could see her and then from the blanket down so why isn't that just a green screen of the yeah that's what it was I think she was holding up a green blanket no no no no sorry sorry no no no there's nothing to do with that okay that's that's the map of dark matter in the universe a three-dimensional map I've tried to give that a shot no we don't know what it is so don't worry about if you don't understand yeah but it's too goddamn confusing for math no it's not confusing at all it's not it's something out there that has 85% of the gravity of the universe and we don't know what the hell it is using it's not confusing it's it's if you don't know what a fuse it is it's confusing by nature okay III have more nuanced definition of confusing confusing is I am confused I don't know how to think dark matter is I don't even know what to think I need something in my head to be confused right dark matter has there's no we don't know what the hell do you anticipate a solution to that or some server sure I want my eyes it in Hawaii I hope damn it might have been yeah now let's go might have been yeah listen folks it's not the gdt there'll be the goddamn it's the TMT 30 meter telescope so yeah solutions to we you don't know part of the what it is to explore is not knowing what it is that you will find and all these telescopes the launched ones as well as the ground-based ones we have enough foresight we're mature enough as a field to know that even though it's designed to look for certain things that were part of the program that you set up for it you want to have a serendipity mode for it you want to be able to say let's point it in some random direction and see what shows up without that you could miss something in plain sight if you're only looking for one thing that you think is there extrapolated from what you knew before and the way I think of it you know there's the old saying as the area of our knowledge grows so too does the perimeter of our ignorant mmm so as that area grows there more places to look over the fence and stare into the abyss of ignorance that awaits you so dark matter is sitting on the other side of the fence that's the way I've heard describes the bonfire of our knowledge grows brighter the area of our ignorant is illuminated okay I have to think about that yeah that's similar to what I said I'm more theater yeah if the bonfire is your knowledge that's lighting the way as it grows bigger you go see more stuff you've never you've never noticed before it's the same principle that's a giant one though man 85 person it's 85 percent of gravity so yeah it's Andy add that to the dark energy we don't know that is either dark matter dark energy comprise 95% of everything that's driving the universe so everything we know and love the chemistry the physics the biology life planets stars is 5% of the universe now so many people theologians and folks say well maybe God is in the other 95% maybe ok yeah made God's dark matter would that be crazy well people say that surprised yeah but I don't know why dark red would care about whether yeah which religion you're right yeah all the religions got their thing wearing yo don't you know I'm God I'm dark matter yeah we by the way just in in letters from an astrophysics physicist which isn't out yet but again I don't know how the hell you got the book but it's there there's an entire chapter where I am conversing with people who were strongly religious there's a conversation I have in there with a Orthodox Jewish person a Muslim multiple fundamentalist Christians and we're talking about the age of the earth and why and why do we think one way or another and so that's there's a lot of intimate stuff in there that I generally don't go public with but I would did it one-on-one with those who had written to me about these challenges they were facing in life and they wanted to know what a national physicist had to say about it what's the youngest version of how old a religious person thinks to the earth is what's the how was the 6,000 years see that's a question yes yet Christian well oh of all and not all Christians by the way no no of all religions I don't know the age College is like a month old idea I don't know enough about how old all the religions think the universe is the youngest you're gonna get the youngest University owner to get from a devout Christian in 6,000 years the oldest is around 10,000 and but it's far and away from billions Mormons are a unique one because they think you get your own planet when you die yeah and what's what's funny horn on that what I want my own planet nobody told me that it's odd how one religious group would would comment on how preposterous another religious groups comments are I love that you know I was once I don't if you know this I was once quoted after I think the the Scientology documentary came out on HBO and everybody was talking about at least I think that was it and there was a lot of chat about it for a couple of weeks and one of the news outlets I forgot who called me up and said do I think Scientology should be a religion classified as a religion as an authentic religion and you can ask well why they calling me Wow well because in Scientology they're aliens and if there's space beings that have us to give up this information oh sorry I died so that's how I got brought into this conversation ah because of the sectors of Scientology that involves space beings okay all right so my answer was we live in a country that protects the free expression of faith based systems provided they don't subtract from the rights of others so I will not sit here and judge whether they tans from space exhumed souls from volcanoes at least a third of what I just said is accurate it's from from the Scientology or whether a man born of a woman is this son of God who died and rose from the dead I'm not going to compare those and judge whether one of them is more authentic than another when they're both founded on belief systems and so in this country belief systems are protected and we've all bought into that and so you know what the headline was Tyson defense that was the clickbait of my comments get clicks you got a distort there there are some rational people who in the comment thread said that's not what he said of course yeah but isn't it more interesting when they do do that and then inside the actual article itself they give your full quote so people can see the deception the real confusing thing is when they take a chunk of your quote so you don't I just go to jail for that by the what so that's interesting so for me I I'm an observer of that not a complainer about it so is that how they're doing it okay so maybe I can shake this phrase differently to minimize the chance of that happening in the future minimize the chance of you being lied about correct so for me that is a landscape there's some landmines here there are some trap doors here there is something and so for me one who communicates on that landscape that's just information for me to navigate it slightly more nimbly in the front yeah got it interesting gravity this is one thing that will still hook to hook up on gravity yes I'm always hooked up on gravity because as you should be well since we've talked last I've been reading a lot about it and one of the things that confuses me the most is that we don't really understand what gravity is we know its effects we can measure them we know how to measure them we know what that mass is involved well we don't really know what gravity is there's a similar question in the book but they got a little more philosophical than you just did but they both leaned philosophical it's science can describe how gravity works but can they describe why can we so this is the how why yeah duality here and allow me to just answer it from a howwhy point of view and then we can apply it to gravity okay after I say that in science if we can describe how something works and predict its future behavior we claim to understand it and we move on you can ask deeper question about why is there gravity what is the meaning what is the purpose and go ahead but I'm good with what I've done and I can land a spacecraft on Mars inside of a crater in a hole in one using my understanding of gravity so I'm pretty good with it okay so I'm not distracted by the more philosophical side of that why does it work okay Einstein so Newton was deeply puzzled by how you can have something called in which he coined the phrase action at a distance okay he wrote down the equation that worked he walked any question goes around the earth earth goes on the Sun the moons of Jupiter go around Jupiter he accurately described that with his equations of gravity okay he said one day I think we're gonna find some way that they're connecting to each other but I don't know what that is right now but I know my equations work he called it spooky it was spooky to him that's his word spooky action at a distance all right fast forward three hundred years three hundred no fast forward two hundred and fifty two hundred thirty years get to Albert Einstein gravity is the curvature of space and time and you're moving on the curvature of that fabric that's gravity oh my gosh is it even a force then is it even so there's no need to think of it as an action at a distance and in a phrase first uttered by I think was John Archibald wheeler or a student of Einstein and he I learned relativity from John Archibald wheeler fact that's where I met my wife in relativity class at school its space so matter tells space how to curve space tells matter how to move it moves on the curvature of space you don't need an action at a distance there is no action it can't do anything else but do that it's like you have a funnel and you take a ball and you roll it on the funnel the ball can only do what that funnel tells it to do and it'll Cirque if you give it a sideways motion it'll start spinning around there's no magic hand coming in there it is following the curvature of its space-time continuum this construct that you provided for it so now I can describe what gravity is doing I even have a mechanism for it are you gonna still ask me why is there gravity is that answered not fulfilling enough to you even in the Y Department because well why would a particle curved space you can just keep doing that that's fine but is there a point really where you'll be satisfied with the answer oh that answers my why I can say well why did this half liter of water drop off the edge here well it's no longer the forces are imbalanced and it's a no but why did it fall well there's nothing holding you know why did there's a point where it's not especially productive to continue to think about the world that way because what I'm claiming is answers to the how when you understand the how enough our tantamount to having answered the why question that's all that's what I'm telling them out in terms of your ability to measure it and accurately use it correct so we can say okay but isn't it you've got a ball yes we can say well why did you go bald well okay the hair follicles at a when you start in your late 20s and early go bald when you start losing your hair probably late twenties early thirties yeah yeah that's that's common if you have your hair when you're thirty you'll probably have it for the rest of your life that's the how that goes you start losing it up right going up to your thirty so you can say well the hair follicle begins does not producing the keratin or whatever we get the explanation then you say well why does the hair follicle stop doing that then you say oh well because the DNA has a pre coded about the hair kind of thing well why does the DNA have the hair well because so whereas we know far more about how and why people go bald than we do about what gravity really is correct I'm telling you gravity really is the curvature of space and time that gets us the Big Bang and everything we've ever known and based in time but it's also based on mass right it's based on the amount of any concentration of matter and energy and or energy will curve the fabric of space and time and the more the movement of matter on that fabric of space and time we call gravity and I'm good with that okay but you seem a little oddly defensive about something that's scientific no I have to say I'm good with this but you you are cuz you kind of defending it no you can say well if Y does matter you need to know why uh-huh why they say no I'm saying why does matter and energy curve the fabric of space and time you can ask that okay why and I don't have an answer if I can say well that's all I'm asking well no what about to what I'm telling you is okay you don't need to watch you to the point all right we had to walk to that point where you're why got unanswered I understand that but but before we got to that point I answered otherwise that I'm not disputing that good good so what I'm telling you is that I can answer your why question most of the time but then you'll come back to a point where there's a point where there's the Y doesn't have the answer so you say why did if falling say there's a force of gravity operating on it why did it fall that way because of the curvature of space and time I'm answering your wise then why does matter an energy curve space and time okay that's a frontier we're still working on that but that's all I'm asking that's good that's one you are a man of science so you are a person that should probably embrace wise accept the many people who ask why questions they really want to no purpose I'm not asking purpose good well then that distinguishes you from many other people who ask why questions oh okay why did you bang the table I was angry there's a purpose behind it okay so so yeah if your Y is just a curiosity of what's going on that's one thing if you are inquiring about purpose then its theological okay because when a theological then religions give purpose to lot merely I'm not doing that right but uh I just think it's amazing that something that's such a massive part of life on this planet that we stayed glued to the ground because of gravity can you pull up my Instagram account that I only posts you have an Instagram account now I had a fake one for a while yeah I took it over mine actually I know that guy I took it over he gave it to you oh dude the guy who had it yeah no no no no actually I sorry yes Instagram said I but people think this is a real account and it's not can I have it back and if it's an account that's an impostor and followers don't know it it's illegal right so so there's there's one that says fan of neil tyson yeah and that's a different one okay so I only post arthouse photos okay that I've taken most of which I've taken so just scroll down and look for Muscle Beach there it is click on that okay so here's my cat go to my caption go fullscreen on that remember my cab okay for most of our life on earth we either resist or succumb to the force of gravity at Muscle Beach gravity loses every time room I was proud of the caption you know you call me out on that caption that's nonsense gravity never loses gravity doesn't even have like little tiny losses there's a war for those just listening to this so I was at I was in Venice California and the Sun was setting behind some guy who was doing who was doing hand pressed hand presses suspended up on this chin up bar right and it was really so it was cool he was silhouetted there's a palm tree there's the beach he's there gravity's gonna beat that [\u00a0__\u00a0] let me tell you eventually but while he is it while he's there he's conquering gravity are you getting too old you haven't come to gravity lately no I work out all the time I'm not buying it yeah concrete [\u00a0__\u00a0] he's pulling rank now so I work out and you don't cuz I see your middle-aged man belly well what I've talked to other astrophysicists and science what way let me yet are these conversations supposed to have a like a theme or a purpose or is it just you sit in just whatever comes your head you send my where are you and me yeah well clearly this episode is about you can't say that I don't ever do you don't do that okay fine that's just episode number two my success no hablo commitment ever have a thread think about all the different people of course of course it's like impossible of calling fighters and scientists and the scholars and crackpots bunch of different people coming through here man I can't have any agenda all right I mean that's probably the only reason why this thing is successful as it is yeah but that's a weird one for people that this one thing that is so powerful what what is Oh gravity that's a weird one for people yeah I mean it seems like you're frustrated by all the various questions no like no you seem a little little defensive there because I follow that I thought you were taking your why to ultimately mean purpose if it's just why I'm claiming that many responses to how are also responses to a why mm-hmm that that's that's the point I'm making and I don't like splitting definitions will ultimately understand gravity I think we do that's why we can land things Mars I think we do which is why your cell phone gets time from GPS satellites that is pre corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity because they're in a different gravitational field than you in orbit than you are on Earth's surface we got this we got Stein his triumphing we're running short on time here so I set you something that I wanted to ask you what's that you I did I did it's about a black hole that landed in a mysterious place in our understandings yes yeah yeah so let me let me just give that I'll give the the the sort of Reader's Digest version of this okay okay there are black holes that are there black holes that are formed at the consequence of the death of stars okay okay and we think we understand the formation of stars well enough to say well star is born with this much mass and it'll lose certain amount of mass over its life all stars lose mass because there's so much pressure and so much energy coming out it carries particles with it so they they lose mass the Sun is losing mass as we speak it's called the solar wind so everybody loses mass out there the question is at what rate are you losing mass is it a lot compared to your total mass is it small so very high mass stars are not especially stable objects they remain stars for a hundred thousand at most a million years and they'll explode and become a supernova if you're more massive than that they will not explode because the gravity is so strong that it cannot explode against the strength of the gravity and it collapses into a black hole so we expect black holes to have slightly less mass somewhat less mass then the most massive stars that we know how to make so if you have a hundred times the mass of the Sun star it'll lose half of its mass over its life and you have a a black hole that 30 times the mass of the Sun or 50 times the mass isn't fine put a pin in that in the Centers of galaxies there are supermassive black holes hundreds of thousands millions times the mass of the Sun and we call their supermassive and their black holes we call them supermassive black holes because that's how we roll as astrophysicists all right well could you have black holes somewhere in the middle of these two extremes we do not know a phenomenon that will give you a black hole that's in beat that will birth a black hole that's in between these two these two categories you can make a black hole that eats its way there fine but we don't know how to make one and we think we colleagues who have done this think they've discovered a black hole that is sitting in this sort of netherworld where there's no evidence that it ate to become that massive and we don't know how to explain it by the formation and death of stars and is nowhere near the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy so it is the frontier of research at this moment so it's just a newly discovered type of black hole it's in a MASH regime that this physically impossible you know headlines we're eating the headline now black hole shock they show me the the where disappears express is this a British I think they're British anyhow it's a news digest for science so black hole shock theories swirl around the discovery of a physically impossible black hole so scientists don't use the word impossible unless it's violating a known law of physics so I bet that was a title and I don't have a product I don't mind a little bit of sensationalism there you can say it is a black hole that comes from and if it comes from an object it is an object we know nothing about and have yet to discover well we're not going to say it's an impossible on Jeff mm-hmm every time we point a telescope to the universe we find something that we never predicted or understood and it adds to the knowledge base already have whenever they do discover things and then that becomes what we know and understand like the supermassive black holes at the center of every galaxy that was a fairly recent discovery in terms it was a sized because we saw the Centers of galaxies behaving really weirdly things stars were moving faster than they should have given how much gravity was tugging on them and we said dude something's got to be there and it's got to be really small because we're tracking star is really close to the middle well if it was made of ordinary matter how big would have to have to be really really big so this has to be really really small in order for this to happen the only thing we know that could fill that small volume and have that much gravity is a black hole so it's suspected for a long time it was confirmed that as a common thing by the Hubble telescope and first photographed by this recent result in the galaxy m87 Messier 87 is what it's that's the name of the galaxy and you can determine how big the black hole is based on the size of the galaxy we can determine the mass of the black hole by how fast stars are moving at the distance they are from it so in other words so so where Earth orbiting the Sun and we have a certain speed we're going about forgot how does it but 18 miles per second I think that's the number 30 kilometers a second that's our speed around that's a speed around the Sun that's pretty fast okay if the Sun had more mass instantly that speed is not enough to maintain our orbit and we'll start spiraling in towards it if the Sun had less mass that speed is too high to be in this orbit it'll take it to up sorry it's too fast to maintain this horbet it'll climb us out to a higher orbit slow us down and we'll be in a higher orbit with a slower speed so in other words for any object at any distance there's only one speed you can maintain and have a stable orbit around it so when we see stars orbiting something in the center of the galaxy it is a straight forward Astro 1:02 equation to calculate how much mass the thing is orbiting and you get the mass and you can't see it it's it's a black hole and that ladies and gentlemen is the end of the podcast ha ha ha this block will be available when Sir comes out in in October first week of October I'm very proud of this book it's my most heartfelt thing that I've ever done well when it comes out I will take a photograph and put it up on the Instagram and the Twitter yeah and it's it's a it also has letters from people in prison a person who had just learned that they were had terminal cancer I mean there's a lot of people reaching out responding to letters yes it's me responding and they're letters I can't fit all of their letters some are very long tones but most of their letters and then all of my correspondence is in there so it's it's my most heartfelt contribution to this universe and Startalk is still upon we're still going still going Startalk would pump it up in 50 episodes and a television show yes so we can see if we're gonna have a new season we don't know yet that's to be announced but we're going to it's always a podcast and I we got a YouTube channel Startalk YouTube channel and we're thinking of branching out into other kinds of educational product that's still fun and comedic and the like and I love your support for this because you're you're also a comedian so you know the value and I love comedians that have their fundamental part of how we deliver science to the public on Startalk so thanks for for that plug my applies are my friend dude thank you always good bye everybody [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "Episode Title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1347 - Neil deGrasse Tyson",
