[{"text": "Welcome back. Here we go, Gabe. Great to see you, and congratulations. Thank you. You will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born. You will know for the rest of this child's life you were born during a weird time. That's for sure. That is for sure, probably the weirdest that I can remember. Yeah, yeah, and he was born on May the 4th. And that's Lares too. Yeah. May the 4th be with him. Yes, exactly. Has to be. May the 4th be with him. Yes, exactly. Has to be. I sure hope so. Perfect. Yes. I mean, that was the perfect day for you. I'm, yeah. And then, how do you say the name? Well, uh... Is it a placeholder? And first of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name. Is it a place? Congratulations to her. Yeah, yeah, she's great at names. So, I mean, it's just X, the letter X. And then, the A-E is pronounced Ash. Yeah, go, Jay. Yeah, and then A-12 is my contribution. Why A-12? Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR-71, coolest plane ever. True. I agree with you. I don't know, I'm not familiar with it. I know what the SR-71 is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what that is. So what? Yeah, I know what that is, but... So, the SR-71 came from a CIA program called Archangel. It's the Archangel Project. And then Archangel 12... Oh, wow, what a dope looking plane. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Yeah. Well as a person who's very much into Aerial travel as you are that's a perfect. It's pretty great. Yeah, pretty great So is it does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going does it feel like you've had Children before is this any weirder? It's actually I think it's better Being older and having a kid. I appreciate it more Hmm. Yeah, baby's awesome. Yeah When I didn't have my any of my own I would see other people's kids and I didn't not like them sure but I wasn't drawn to them Sure, but now when I see little people's kids I'm like oh I think of them like these little love packages Yeah, little love books Yeah It's just you you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you Like your whole idea what a baby is is very different. Yeah Yeah. So now as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult, it must be really pretty wonderful. Yeah. Wonderful. It's great. Babies are awesome. They are. Yeah. That's great. They are. Yeah. I mean, also, I've spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets. And so you can sort of see the kind of the brain develop, which is an AI neural net that is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. And you can sort of see the learning very quickly. You know, it's just, wow. See things fire. So you're talking about the neural net. You're not talking about an actual baby. I'm talking about an actual baby. But both of them. Yes. But the word neural net comes from the brain. It's like a net of neurons. So it's like the humans are the original gangster neural net. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. So when you are programming artificial intelligence, where you're working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain? Yeah. In a lot of ways. There's some ways that are different. An analogy that's often used is like, we don't make a submarine swim like a fish. But we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to a submarine. I've always wondered, as a layperson, do you try to achieve the same results as a human brain, but through different methods, or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results? The essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. Neural net. Having the multiple layers of neurons and back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition. And then it'll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It's interesting, very interesting.

When artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they're like, oh, you tried to mimic yourself. So much better process cut out all this nonsense. Like I said, there are elements that are the same. And just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird, it doesn't flap its wings. But the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as bird. Now you're in the middle of this strange time where you're selling your houses, you say you don't want any material possessions and I've been seeing all that and I've been really excited to talk to you about this because it's an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Why are you doing that? Yeah. I'm slightly sad about it actually. If you're sad about it, why are you doing it? I think possessions kind of weigh you down. They're kind of an attack vector. People say, hey, billionaire, you got all this stuff. Well, now I know stuff, now what are you going to do? Attack vector meaning people target it. Interesting, yeah. But you're obviously going to, so you're going to rent a place? Yeah. Okay. And get rid of everything, sub-close? And get rid of everything, sub-close? No, I said almost everything. Keep a couple Teslas. Teslas, kind of have to, test product and stuff. The things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those here. It was kind of have to. Yeah. What's the worst thing that happened? I mean, you're fine. Yeah, you could always buy more stuff if you don't like it. I suppose so. Yeah, I mean, from the money that you sell all your stuff, you could buy new stuff. I suppose so. people define you by the fact that you're wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way? For sure, I mean, not everyone, but there's, for sure, in recent years, billionaire has become a pejorative, like it's a pejorative. It's like that's a bad thing, which I think doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases. If you've done, if you basically organized a company, so how does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before, and you have some ownership in that company, then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital. So there's a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. So let me say Warren Buffett, for example, and to be totally frank, I'm not his biggest fan, but he does a lot of capital allocation, and he reads a lot of sort of annual reports of companies, and we'll be counting, and it's pretty boring, really. And he's trying to figure out is, does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean, that's, I mean, it's kind of a boring job, if you ask me, but it's still a thing that's important to figure out, like which is a company deserving of more or less capital? Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital, and if it's not, it should get less. We'll go out of business. Well, there's a big difference too between someone who's making an incredible amount of money, designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who's making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around the stock market or doing things along those lines. It's a different thing, and to put them all in the same category seems, it's very simple. And as you pointed out, it's an attack vector. It's a different thing. And to put them all- I mean I think it's really, I do think in the United States especially there's an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically too many smart people go into finance and law. So this is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have I think fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it's often looked down upon which I think is wrong. Yeah. Well I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China that there's a lot of value into making things and to making things here. Yes. Somebody's got to do the real work. Yeah.

You know so yeah it should be more of it. Yeah. Do you have a moment where is just something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realized that. Yeah I've been thinking about it for a while. You know a part of it is like I like have a bunch of houses but I don't spend a lot of time in most of them and that doesn't seem like a good use of assets. Like somebody could probably be in front of those houses and get better use of them than me so. Don't you have Gene Wilder's house? I do. That's amazing. It's awesome. Wow. I do. That's amazing. It's awesome. Wow. Exactly what you'd expect. Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up? Yeah, that's a requirement. Oh, a requirement? That's a good requirement? Yeah. In that case. In that house. Yeah. It'll probably sell for less, but still don't care. He's a legend. He'd want his soul. Yeah. He'd want his essence. Yeah. In the building. He's also. And it's there. It's a real quick. Is it quirky house? Yeah, is it quirky house? Yeah What what makes you say it's there? Like what do you get out of it? I mean all the all the cabinets are like can't handmade and they're like odd shapes and there's like doors to nowhere and strange like car doors and tunnels and odd odd paintings on the wall and Yeah, did you ever live in it? It's very quirky. I I did live in it briefly. Yeah, really? Yeah, but why do you buy houses? Like if you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go? I think I'd like to have that. Well, I you know had one house and then the June Wilder house right across the road from me from from my main house and it was gonna get it was gonna get sold and then torn down and turn into you know be a big construction zone for three years and I was like, well, I think I'll buy it and preserve the spirit of June Wilder and not have a giant construction zone and then the you know this I started having like some privacy issues where like people would like let's people just like come to my house and You know start climbing over the walls and stuff like man So then I said like what a house some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point well You know, it'd be cool to to build a house. So then I said acquired some properties at the top of Samara Road and which is Got a great view and it's like okay. Well these some bunch of sort of small older houses. They're gonna get torn down anyway I was like, well, you know, if I collect these like little little houses then I can build something You know, I don't know artistic like a you know dream house type of thing What's a dream house for Elon Musk like some Tony Stark type shit? Yeah, definitely Yeah, you got to have the the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know Yeah, for sure. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah, but but then I was like man Do I really want it doesn't really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I'd be real you know get a like OCD on the little details and the design and Or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter So yeah, you know, like what's more important Mars or a house? I like Mars Okay, is that really how you think like that? It'd be better off Planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean The you can only do so many things right, right? So how you know, I don't know how you do what you do Anyway, I don't I don't understand how you can run both with a boring company Tesla SpaceX all these different things you're doing constantly I just I don't understand I mean you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is insane I still don't the the productivity is Baffling just doesn't make sense how you can get so much done.

It's a good chunk. Yeah, that's a good chunk. It's a good chunk Yeah, we were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live when it's Actually going to be available a testing on people right now. No, we're not testing people yet. But I I think it won't be too long, I think we may be able to implant a neural link in Less than a year In a person I think and when you do this Is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this? To see what percentage of people's bodies are going to reject these things? Is it put is it there is there a potential for rejection? It's a very low potential for rejection. I mean you can think of it like people put in you know heart monitors and You know things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation Obviously like, you know, artificial hips and right knees and that kind of thing. So the Probability of I mean like it's so it's well known like what will cause rejection what what will not It's definitely hotter when you've got something that is Sort of reading and writing neurons that's that's generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That's that's a little hotter Then it then it then say passive device, but it's still you know, very doable and Yeah, there there are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now. Yeah, what kind of devices? I would like to deep brain stimulation is fighting for Parkinson's is has Really changed people's lives in a big way Which is kind of remarkable because we're it kind of like zaps your brain it's like kicking the TV type of thing You think like man kicking the TV shouldn't work Yeah, yeah the old old TVs I did my grandpa used to slap the top. Yeah. Yeah the old old TVs it did for sure Yeah, yeah, it would work sometimes. Yeah, so there's deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain that Have changed people's lives for the better like fundamentally Let's talk about what you can talk about to what neural link is because the last time you were here I really couldn't discuss it and then there was a I guess a press release something that sort of Yeah, that that happened quite a bit after the last time you were here. So what exactly is it? How do you do? What what happens if someone ultimately does get a neural link installed? What will take place? Yeah, well for version one of the device it would be basically implanted in your skull, so But it would be Flushed with your skull. So you basically Take out a chunk of skull replace put the neural link device in there you put the the electrode you'd insert the electrode threads very carefully into the the brain and and then you You know stitch it up and and you wouldn't even know that somebody has And then and so then it it can interface basically anywhere Anywhere in your brain so it could be something that you know helps cure say I site like give you returns your eyesight, even if you've like lust your optic nerve type of thing Okay, really? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely hearing obviously. Um, I Mean pretty much anything that where that it could in principle fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain and it could restore limb functionality, so if you've got a interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that's say That's like a microcontroller in near muscle groups you could then create a Sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who's a quadriplegic to full Functionality like they can walk around be normal. Really? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Whoa. Yeah, so maybe slightly better slightly better over time. Yes, you mean with future iterations relations like the you know, six million dollar man, although these days that would Yeah, although these days that would that doesn't that's pretty much. Yeah Six billion dollar man. So the the hole would be small How big would the whole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece? It's only one hole well Yeah, the device we're working on right now is about it's about an inch in diameter And your skulls pretty thick by the way, so skulls are minus for sure. It might actually literally be I mean if you're a big if you're a big guy your skull is actually fairly thick Skulls like it's like seven to fourteen millimeters So probably couple inches a half inch, you know half inch thick skull ish. So Yeah, so that that's a fair bit of like our we got quite a coconut going on. It's not it's not like some eggshell Oh, yeah, I believe you so the Yeah, you basically Implant the device and so you would be like a one inch square One inch in diameter. Yeah, like so an inch circle like a circular One. Yeah, like so. Yeah, I think like a like a smartwatch or something or Okay, yeah Okay, so you take okay. So you take this one inch down in it Like ice fishing right? Here we go ice fishing. I'm no but I'd like to it's great. Yeah, it's really fun Yeah, so it's great. Yeah, it's really fun. Yeah, so you basically take an auger and you You drill it too through the surface of the ice Yeah and you create a small hole. Yeah, you can dunk your line in there So this is like that your ice fishing on the top of your skull and then you cork it real Yeah, and you replace that, say, one-inch diameter piece of skull with this neural length device. And that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger. And then you also get to insert the electrodes. So the electrodes are very carefully inserted with a robot that we developed that's very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries. So it doesn't create trauma. So through this one-inch diameter device, electrodes be inserted and they will find their way. Tiny wires, basically. Tiny wires. Tiny wires. And they'll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate? This tiny wires, basically. Tiny wires. Tiny wires. No, you literally put them where they're supposed to go. Oh, OK. Yeah. You should insert them. How long will these wires be? Yeah, you should insert them \u2013 usually go in like you know depending on where it is like you get two or three millimeters. So they just find the spots. Yeah and then yeah you put the device in and that that gets that that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out and then you stitch up the hole and you have to step it like a little scar and that's it.

They could lose the ability to speak And that that also that could also be fixed So she got like stroke damage or you lose say You know muscle control over part of your face or something like that I think you and then when you get old you tend to if you get like, you know Alzheimer's or something like that then you Lose memory and this could help you with You know restoring your memory like a thing we're storing memory and what what is happening happening that's allowing it to do that like the wires these these small wires you know stimulating these areas of the brain and then is it that the areas of the brain or they're they're losing some sort of electrical force like what what is happening yeah yeah it's like it's like the thing of it's like a bunch of circuits and there's some like circuits that are broken and we can like uh fix those circuits substitute for those circuits And so a specific frequency will go through this? Yeah, it just says. Specific in that, is the process figuring out how much or how little has to be, how much these areas of the brain have to be juiced up? Yeah, it just says. Yeah, I mean, there's still a lot of work to do. So when I say, you know, we got a shot at probably putting in a person in, you know, within a year, I think that's exactly what I mean. I think we have a chance of putting in someone and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they've lost.

I mean, ultimately, if you wanna go with full AI symbiosis, you'll probably wanna do something like that. Symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to AI. It's optional. I would hope so. Yeah. It's just, I mean, once you enjoy the Dr. Manhattan lifestyle, once you become a god, seems very, very unlikely, you're gonna wanna go back to being stupid again. I mean, you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other. Yeah. Yes. Yes. You wouldn't need to talk. I'm so scared of that, but so excited about it at the same time. Is that weird? Yeah, I mean, I think this is one of the paths to, you know, like, think like, what are the, like, AI is getting better and better. So, now let's assume it's sort of like a benign AI scenario. Even in a benign scenario, we're kinda left behind. You know, we're not along for the ride. We're just too dumb. Right. So, how do you go along for the ride? Right. Yeah, so you can't beat him, join him. So, and we're already a cyborg to some degree, right? Because you've got your phone, you've got your laptop. Glasses. Yeah, yeah, you can do it. You know, electronic devices. Yeah. And, I mean, today, if you don't bring your phone along, it's like you have Messing-Lem syndrome. That's like, you know, feels like something's really, really missing. So, we're already partly... Glasses. Yeah, yeah, good job. You know, electronic devices. You know, partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially. It's just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. So, especially output. Like, you're just going with your thumbs. I mean, like, what's your data rate? Maybe, optimistically, 100 bits per second. That's being generous. And now the computer can communicate at like, you know, 100 terabits. So, certainly, you know, gigabits are a travail at this point. So, this is like, you know, basically, your computer could do things a million times faster. Or, at a certain point, it's like, the AI is like, token or a tree. Okay, it's just boring. You can talk to a tree. It's not very entertaining. So, if you can solve the data rate issue and especially output, but input two, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine. So, you can improve it in what... When you said you won't have to talk to each other anymore, we used to joke around about that. I've joked around about that a million times in this podcast, that one day in the future, there's gonna come a time where you can read each other's minds. And you'll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a non-verbal, non-physical way, where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth. Well, yeah, exactly. And make noises, and make noises. Exactly, so when you... Like, what happens when you... Let's say you've got some complex idea that you're trying to convey to somebody else. And how do you do that? Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words, and there's a lot of loss, information loss, that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words. And when you say those words, those words are then interpreted, then they're decompressed by the person who is listening, and they will at best get a very incomplete understanding of what you're trying to convey. It's very difficult to convey complex concept with precision. Because you've got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly. And so communication is difficult. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Yes, and there's a great movie. There's an interpretation factor too, like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in different ways. And they're dependent upon tone, dependent upon social cues, even facial expressions, sarcasm. There's a lot of variables. Yeah, sarcasm is difficult. Yes.

They just know how to do it. And they know how to do it really quickly. Like they learn really quickly, and they show me how to edit things. And it's if you taught a child from first grade on how to use some new universal language, I mean, essentially like a Rosetta Stone and something that's done with that interprets your thoughts, and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation with clear, very clear, where you know what a person's saying, and you can tell them what you're saying. And there's no need for noises, no need for mouth noises, no need for these sort of accepted ways that we've sort of evolved to make sounds that we all agree through our cultural dictionary, and we agree or certain we could bypass all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can still do it for fundamental reasons. Right. Like campfires. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. I don't need campfires. I don't need to roast marshmallows, which is kind of fun. So yeah, I think you would in principle, you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas. And language would not show what would happen to language. But you could probably, within a situation like this, that you would be able to just feel kind of like the matrix, you want to speak a different language. Right. That's why it was downloaded the program. Right. Right. So at least for the first iterations, first few iterations, we'll just be able to use like, I know that Google has their, some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time. Sure. Yeah, you can hear it. And they'll it'll play things back to you and whatever language you choose. So to be something along those lines for the first few iterations. Yeah. Well, the first few iterations are, I mean, what I'm talking about is like in the limit over time, you know, with a lot of development, the first few iterations, really in the first few versions, all we're going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries. Um, so it's like, don't, don't, don't worry that there's not going to sneak up on you. Um, does this, this will take a while. How many years before you don't have to talk? If the, if, if the development continues to accelerate, then maybe like five years, five to 10 years. That's quick. That's really quick. That's the best case scenario. No talking anymore in five. Best case scenario. Best case scenario. But tens, tens more like it. I've always speculated that aliens could potentially be us in the future, because if you look at like the size of their heads and the fact that they have very little muscle and they're, they're, they don't use their their mouth anymore. They was tiny little, I mean, the archetypal alien that you see in like closing counters of the third kind, they're like, if you went from, like, Australia Pythagus, or ancient hominid to us, what's the difference less hair, less muscle, bigger head, and then just keep going 1000 million, whatever your or five years, whatever, whatever happens when neural link goes on online, and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don't use our muscles anymore. We have this gigantic head, we can talk without words where you could also save state and save state, save state, like, save your brain state, like, like a saved game in a video game and save state. Whoa. Like, like if you want to swap from Windows 95. Well, like, well, a little better than that. But yeah, I think we are Windows 95 right now. My future, my future perspective, probably. But yeah, I mean, you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you if you wanted to in the future, in principle, it's like nothing like from a physics standpoint that prevents us that you'd be a little different, but then you're also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday, and you're a little different. In fact, if you say like, you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference. Yeah. So you'd be substantially you I mean, you'd be you'd certainly think you're you but the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state, like ", "seq_num": 2, "video_id": null, "episode_title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk", "guest": "Elon Musk", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8", "date_posted": "2020-05-07T13:00:07Z", "Topics": ["The potential of neural link technology", "The concept of saving and replaying memories", "Speculation on the evolution of humans and aliens", "The concept of reality and simulation theory"]}, {"text": "you can hang out with 30 year old you and the possibilities are endless. I mean, these things think like how your phone can you can record videos on your phone. Like there's no way you could remember a video right as accurately as your phone or a camera, you know, could. So if you've got like, you know, some some, you know, version 10, your link, whatever, and far in the future, you could, you could remember, you could recall everything, but just like it's a movie, including all the entire sensory experience, emotions, everything, everything, everything, and play it back. And edit it like this. Yeah. You could change what you think was your past. Yeah. Well, so if you had like, this whole thing right now Could be a replay memory. Well, so if you had like this whole thing right now, it could be Yeah, it maybe what's the odds of this being a replay memory, if you had a guess. It's more than 50%. Yeah, there's no way to assign a probability with accuracy here. Right, but roughly, if you just had a just gut instinct. Well, I don't have a neural link in my brain, so I'd say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a neural link, then it rises above 0%. The idea that we're experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is, even though it's still the same, it's not comforting, right? For some reason, when people talk about simulation theory, they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation. Even though your life might be wonderful, you might be in love, you might love your career, you might have great friends, but it's not comforting to know that this experience somehow or another doesn't exist in a material form that you can knock on. Feels real, doesn't it? Feels real! Feels real! But the The idea that it's not is, for some strange reason, disconcerting. Well, yeah, I'm sure it should be disconcerting. Because then if this is not real, what is? Right. But there's that old sort of thought experiment of, how do you know you're not a brain in a vat? I mean, here's the thing. You are a brain in a vat. Then that vat is your skull. Yes. And everything you see, feel, hear, everything. All your senses are electrical signals. Everything, everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vat where the vat is your skull. And all your hormones, all your neurotransmitters, all these things are drugs. Adrenaline is a drug. Dopa means a drug. You're a drug factory. You're constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and beauty. Changes your state. Great music changes your state. Absolutely, sure. And yet, here's another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say, where did consciousness arise? Well, assuming you believe in physics, which appears to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, like basically elements of periodic table, but mostly hydrogen, basically. And then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later, that hydrogen became sentient. Where along the way did consciousness, what's the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here? When do we call it? When do we call it consciousness? I was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey, riding a motorcycle down the street, jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby. Yeah, I saw that one, it worked out well. Is that monkey conscious? It seems like it is. It seems like it had a plan. It was riding a fucking motorcycle and the jumped off the motorcycle to try to steal a baby. Yeah, I saw that one. It worked out well. Yeah, seems pretty. The one that just dragged baby down the street pretty far. Yeah. Yeah. It seems pretty confident. Yeah, it seems pretty conscious, right? There's definitely some degree of consciousness there. Yeah, it's not like it's not a worm. It seems to be on another level Yeah, and it's gonna keep going and That that's the real concern When when people think about the potential future versions of human beings, especially when you consider Symbiotic relationship to artificial intelligence that will be unrecognizable That one day will be so far removed from what this is We'll look back on this the way we look back now on you know Simple simple organisms that we evolved from it seems to be and that it won't be that far in the future That we do have this this view back well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more more sophisticated and complex and and that it understands the Questions to ask about the universe. Do you think that's the case? As a human being as yourself, you're clearly Really? Trying to make conscious decisions to be a better version of you, right?

A super accelerated version of that. Yes, I mean, you don't always improve, but you can aspire to improve. Ah, you can aspire to be less wrong. Yeah. This is like, I think a good, the tools of physics are very powerful, like, just assume you're wrong and you're asking your goal to be less wrong. I don't think you're going to, if you succeed everyday and being less wrong, but if you're gonna succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you're doing great. Yeah, that's a great way of putting an aspire to be less wrong. But then when people look back on nostalgia about simpler times, there's that too. It's very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires. But you can still have a campfire. Yes, yes. But will you appreciate it when you're a super nerd, when you're connected to the grid, and you have some skull cap in place of the top of your head, and it's interfacing with the international language, that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people? Yeah, sure, I think so. Yeah, I like campfires. I'm just worried. I mean, everyone's always scared of change, but I'm scared of this monumental change where we won't talk anymore. I mean, that thing- We'll communicate. Yes, but that's- We'll communicate. There's something about the beauty of the crudeness of language, where when it's done eloquently, it's satisfying, and it hits us in some sort of a visceral way. Like, ah, that person nailed it. I love that they nailed it. Like, that it's so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way, in an articulate way, that makes someone- Like, you read a quote, a great quote by a wise person, it makes you excited that their mind figured something out, put the words together in a right way that makes your brain pop. Like, oh yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Clever compression of a concept. Yeah. And a feeling. Yeah. And a feeling. But the fact that a human did it, too. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Do you think that it'll be electronic music? Like, people won't appreciate it, like they appreciate a slide guitar? I like electronic music. I do, too. Yeah. While you make it. I know you like it. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, and I hope the future is more fun and interesting and I appreciate you trying to make it that way. I hope it's more fun and interesting, too. Yeah. I just, you know, I just hope you don't lose anything along the way. Yeah, at least a little. But hopefully we'll gain. But hopefully we gain more than we lose. Yeah, that's the thing, right, gaining more than we lose. Something that makes us interesting is that we're so flawed. It's not for sure. It's not for sure. I mean, I look at civilizations through the ages, Most of them, you know, they rose and fell. Yeah. And I do think like the globalization that we have at the sort of like the meme sphere is, there's not enough isolation between countries or regions. It's like if you get up, if there's a mind virus, that mind virus can infect too much of the world. You know, like I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people because it's like, man, we don't ever want to, everywhere it will be the same for sure. And then we need some kind of like mind viral immunity. So that's what's concerning. Mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like neural link gets established, the real concern is something that, I mean, you said it's Bluetooth, right? Or some future version of that. That the idea is that something could possibly get into it and fuck it up, or some future version of that. No, I'm talking about like somebody, there's some kind of concept that happens right now.

Would that be an issue too with, this is a very have versus have not issue, right? Once this thing, if this really does, I mean, initially it's going to help people with injuries but you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change. Yes. But the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don't have it yet. Yes, well, I mean, it's the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don't know, dramatically maybe by a factor of 10 with it. So you could definitely just, you know, I don't know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Yeah. Should be super smart. Yeah. Should be super smart. Well, in a capitalist society, you know, it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well, he'd be so far ahead they could never catch you. Is that a concern? Well, I think the, I'm just not a super huge concern. I mean, there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. Yeah. I mean, you can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that's far smarter than an individual. Like I couldn't personally build like a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That's impossible. But, you know, we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and like, you know, piecing it out to different people and using like, you know, computers and machines and stuff, we can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station, that kind of thing, you know. So that already exists where there's, you know, where there's a, corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. Yeah. But the, like we should be, I think, less concerned about like relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly, you know, beyond us and decoupled from human will, you know. Decoupled from human, so this is the, if you can't beat them, join them. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean. So you feel, so you feel like it's inevitable, like AI, it's essentially an AI. It's essentially inevitable. Super sentient AI, yeah. Like beyond a level that's difficult to understand. Impossible to understand, probably. And somehow or another, us, so it's almost like, it's a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with AI. It's not a requirement, it's just if you wanna be along for the ride, then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you've got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of, for argument's sake, it's like the limbic system, basically. And you've got the cortex. Now the brain purists will argue with this definition, but essentially you've got the primitive brain and you've got the sort of smart brain, or the brain that's capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can't understand. Now the, your cortex is much, much smarter than your limbic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven't met anyone who wants to delete the limbic system or the cortex. That people are quite happy having both. So you can think of the, this as being, like the computer of the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that is, like that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It would be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers. And you actually have that right now. Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. You know, storing your terabytes of information perfectly. Doing incredible calculations that, you know, we couldn't even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It's just like I said, the data rate is slow. The connection is weak. Why is it so disconcerting? Or why does it not give me comfort to think about, like when I think about a symbiotic connection to AI, I always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. Is that a bad way to look at it? I don't think that's not quite, that's not how it would be.

Yeah, phones, computers, laptops. Yeah, yeah. And there's quite a bit of AI going on. You know, so artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming, more and more. So you are connected. You know, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it's using a neural net to decode your speech and try to understand what you're saying. You know, if you're trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of your photograph, it's using the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it's just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow. When do you think you're gonna do it? How long will you wait? Like once it starts becoming available? Once it starts becoming available? Yeah, if it works, I'll do it, sure. Right away. I mean, let's make sure it works. How do we make sure it works? We try it on prisoners? Like what do you do? No, no. Take rapists? No. Cut holes in their head? No, like I said, if somebody's got a serious brain injury. Right. And then, you know, people have very severe brain injuries. And then you can fix those brain injuries. And then you prove out that it works and you have envelope expand and make more and more brain injuries. It's sold more and more. And then at a certain age, we all are gonna get Alzheimer's. We're all gonna get senile. And then, you know, moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing. And so, you know, it's like you said, okay, well, you know, this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you're able to function much later in life. So I think that, so essentially, almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use a neural link. And then it's like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer. Right. Do you ever sit down and extrapolate? Do you ever sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to? Yeah, I mean, I think that's, sure, think about it a lot. There's, yeah, I mean, I think that's, like I said, there's not something that's gonna sneak up on you. You know, there's like getting FDA approval for this stuff is not like overnight, you know. And, you know, there's, I mean, we probably, we have to be on like version 10 or something before, you know, it would realistically be, you know, a human AI, somebody, a situation. So you'll see it coming, you know. You see it coming, but what do you think it's gonna be? Like when you sit, when you're alone, if you have free time, I don't know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next, onward, keep going, and you drag it out with improvements along the way, and leaps and bounds, and technological innovations, and where do you see it? What are we gonna be? Like when? 20, 25 years from now, what are we gonna be? Well, seeming civilization is still around. It's looking fragile right now. I think we could have a, in 25 years, probably something, I would think there could be a whole brain interface. A whole brain interface. Something pretty close to that, yeah. How does, how do you define, what do you mean by whole brain interface? Like almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself, if you want. AI extension of yourself. What does that mean to you, like when you say AI extension of yourself. Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself in your phone, you know, and computers and stuff so, and online, it's like somebody dies, there's like an online ghost that their online stuff is still alive in your phones. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone's tweets after they're dead. Yeah. Yeah, Instagram and their stories and stuff. Yeah. Whatever, Facebook and stuff.

It's like some people just get a cough. My idea, what are you talking about? Other people, it gets much worse. Sure. It's this thing. Yeah, I know. We'll just get a cough. My idea, what are you talking about? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking. Yeah. Well, out of nowhere, that's what's crazy. It's like you go back to November, nothing. Now, here we are, December, January, February, March, April, May, six months. Totally different world. So from nothing to everything's locked down. There's so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed, what has happened. You find things where there was a meat packing plant, I believe in Missouri, where 300 plus people were asymptomatic, tested positive, were asymptomatic. And then in other places, it just ravages entire communities and kills people. And it's so weird. It almost appears on the, like if you didn't know any better, you'd be like, what? It seems like there's a bunch of different viruses. It doesn't seem like it's the same thing. Or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of people. Yeah. I mean, I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it's kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. So yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It's much, much less. It's like probably at least a order of magnitude less. Well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems. Yeah, I mean, if you're, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have like basically existing conditions and by age and if you're below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It's not zero, but it's extremely low. They didn't think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it's a situation where once they've proceeded in a certain way, it's very difficult to correct course? It's almost like people really wanted a panic. It's quite crazy. But in some places, a panic is deserved, right? Like if you're in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone's on intubators and it seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick, in some places that fear is justified. But then in other places, you're reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They're having to furlough doctors and nurses because there's no work for them. Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases, they're at 30% capacity. And is this because they've decided to forego elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for? Yes, I mean, and we're not talking about just, some of these elective procedures are quite important. It's like you have a bad heart. And you need a triple bypass. It's like sort of elective, but if you don't get it done in time, you're gonna die. It's bad heart. And you need a triple bypass. Elective is a weird word. Elective is a weird word. It's not like plastic surgery. It's like, it's more like my hip is, I'm in extreme pain because my hip's blown out, or my knee, and I don't wanna go to the hospital, I can't go to the hospital to, you know, people in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, you know, like people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it's a problem. It's not good, it's not good. It seems like the state of public perception is shifting. It is.

Do you think that the current way we're handling this, the social distancing, the masks, the locking down, does this make sense? Is it adequate, or do you think that we should move back to, at least closer to where we used to be? Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing, no matter what. You know, wash your hands and, you know, and if you're coughing, stay home or wear a mask. This is not good, you know. If I could do that in Japan, that's like normal. If you're ill, you wear a face mask and you don't cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands, it's also good. Well, that's the speculation Yeah, it's worse. Well, that's the speculation why men get it more than women, because men are disgusting, we don't wash our hands as much. Men are disgusting, it's true. It's true, I admit. All men in this room, we're all gross, we watch our hands as much. Men are disgusting, it's true. I admit it, bro, I'm all men and women. Yes, go to the restroom, you can see us. Yes, we're gross, my daughter, yes, we're gross. My daughter, my nine-year-old daughter yells at me. She goes, did you wash your hands? She makes me go back and wash my hands. She's right. Nine years old, if I had a nine-year-old boy, you think you would care? You wouldn't give a fuck if I washed my hands. True. So, yeah, I think there's definitely some civil endings here, and improved hygiene, and- Yes, and awareness of potential. Yes, and I think this has shaken up the system. The system is somewhat maravund, with a lot of layers of bureaucracy, and I think that we've cut through some of that bureaucracy. And if we, at some point, there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate, debate about what's high, but I mean, someone that's killing a lot of 20-year-olds, let's say, like if you had Ebola type of mortality. Spanish flu, something, taxing the existence of healthy people, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Taxing the existence of healthy people, yeah. Yeah, but it's, yeah, killing large numbers of young, healthy people, that's, you know, to find that as high mortality, then that, this is at least practice for something like that. And I think there's, given it's a matter of time, that there will be eventually some such pandemic. Do you think that, in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality, that we got lucky in the sense, I mean, people that didn't get lucky and died, of course, I'm not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I'm saying overall, as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures. Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's a good chance, it's highly likely, I think, coming out of this, that we will develop vaccines that we didn't have before for coronaviruses and other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it's received. So there's definitely a lot of silver linings here. And- Potentially, potentially, if we act correctly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's, I think there will be some amount of silver lining here no matter what. Hopefully it could be more of a silver lining than less. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, this is kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate. And we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young, healthy people. Yeah.

And I think it's in a lot of ways, it's, I don't want to say a misused resource, but it's like giving monkeys guns. They just start gunning down things that are in front of them without any realization of what they're doing. They have a rock, they see a window, they throw it. Whoa, look at that, I got Elon mad. Look at that, this guy got mad at me. This, I fucking took this person down on Twitter. I got this lady fired. Oh, the fucking business is going under because of Twitter Wars. It seems like there's something about it that's this new found thing that, I don't want to say abuse, but just I want to say that it's almost like, you hit the button and things blow up, you're like, wow. What else can we blow up? Sure, I mean, I've been in the Twitter war zone for a while here, so it takes a lot to phase me at this point. Yeah, that's good too, right? Like you develop a thick skin. Yeah, you can take it personally. A lot of these people don't actually know you. It's like if you're fighting a war and there's some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it's not like they hate you, they don't even know you. Right, yeah. So just think of it like that, they have fire and bullets or whatever, but they don't know you, so don't take it personally. There's something interesting about it too. It's like when you write something in 280 characters and they write something into it, it's such a crude way. It's like someone's sending opposing smoke signals that refute your smoke signals. It's so crude, especially when you're talking about something like Neuralink. You're talking about some future potential where you're gonna be able to express pure thoughts that get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus tweets. Well, there'll always be some ambiguity, but tweets are, it's hard. Maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something. Right, right. Or I'm not just kidding or whatever, you know. It seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it's sarcasm. If everybody knew that the onion wasn't real, if you sent people articles, it is something about someone getting angry at an onion article. Wow, that's amazing. You know what I mean, where they don't realize what it is, there's something fun about that for everybody else. Yeah, onion's pretty great, might be the best news source. Do you know who Titania McGrath is? Hilarious, it's Andrew Boyle. He's a British fellow, brilliant guy, who's been on the podcast before and he has this fictional character, this pseudonym, Titania McGrath, who's like the ultimate social justice warrior.

I find Twitter quite engaging. How do you have the time? Why, I mean, it's like five minutes every couple hours type of thing. It's not like I'm sitting on an all day. But even five minutes every couple hours, if those are bad five minutes, they might be bouncing around in your head for the next 30.

It was annoying, but it was also annoying as a person who reads CNN and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. I would like to think that. I would like to think that. Yeah, I don't think CNN is that. I think it used to be. It used to be, yeah. What do you think's the best source of just like information out there? That's a good question. Like, let's say you're just like average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what's going on, like how to live your life and just looking for what's going on in the world. It's hard to find something that isn't. That's a good question. That's good. Yeah. Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to make sloppy reporting and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. Yeah. You're just trying to figure out what's going on. It's like, I'm hard pressed to, where do you go? Yeah. I don't know. I don't think there's any pure form. My favorite places are the New York Times and the LA Times. And I don't trust them 100%. Because also, there's individuals that are writing these stories. And that seems to be the problems, these individual biases and these individual, there's purposely distorted perceptions. And then there's ignorantly reported facts. And there's so many variables. And you've got to put everything through this filter of where's this person coming from. Do they have political biases? Do they have social biases? Are they upset because of their own shortcomings? And are they projecting this into the story? It's so hard, stories. Exactly. I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to the publication. I go with whatever Matt Taibbi says. Okay. I trust him more than anybody. All right. Matt Taibbi's onto something. I just, as far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything, I just listen to him above most, above most, he's my go-to guy. All right, I'll check it out. Oh, it's Rolling Stone's articles. His stuff on the savings and loan crisis, he's just like, what in the fuck? Sure. And he wasn't an economist by any stretch of the imagination. So he had to really sort of deeply embed himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it. Yep. And with also with the humorous flair. No, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. But it's not that many of them. It's hard and not a location where we are no bullshit. We are no bullshit.com. The one place where you can say, this is what we know, this is what we don't know, this is what we think, not this person's wrong and here's why. Like, oh, God damn it. You know, I can't. You don't know. There's a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation. Yeah. This particular coronavirus issue that we're dealing with right now seems to be a great illuminator of that very fact is that there's so much data and there's so much that's open to interpret. There's so many things, because it's all happening in real time, right? And like particularly right now in California, we're in stage two tomorrow or Friday, two days from now.

Like, no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives, but yet ensure that our culture and that our economy survives. It's a lot of speculation and guessing, but if you go to certain places, they'll tell you, we know why and we know this and we know, oh, it's hard. It's hard to know. Yeah, I mean, in general, I think that's like, we should be concerned about anything that's a massive infringement on our civil liberties. Yes. So it's like, you gotta put a lot of weight on that. A lot of people die to win independence with the country and fight for the democracy that we have. And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. I think we probably did that, actually. Yes. Well, I like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home, require people to not go to work, and to arrest people for trying to make a living, this all seems wrong. And I think it's a wrong approach. It's an infantilization of the society. That dad is gonna tell you what to do. Fundamentally, a violation of the Constitution, freedom of assembly and it's just, I mean, I don't think these things stand up in court, really. Yeah, they're arresting people for protesting because they're protesting and violating social distancing and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home. Yeah, these would definitely not stand up if the Supreme Court here, I mean, it's obviously complete violation, right? Yeah, yeah. And again, this is not in any way disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. It's certainly a real thing to think of. Yeah, I mean, it just should be, if you're at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but you should also not be, if you're not at risk or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life you should have the right to do that. Right, and it seems like at this point in time, particularly, our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life how they did, particularly having a career and making a living and feeding your family. Paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open, paying your bills. Yes, I mean, there's a strong downside to this. Yeah. So, yeah, I just believe if this is a free country, you should be allowed to do what you want, as long as it does not endanger others. But that's the thing, right? This is the argument they will bring up. You are endangering others. You should stay home for the people that, even if you're fine, even if you know you're going to be OK, there's certain people that will not be OK, because of your actions. They might get exposed to this thing that we don't have a vaccine for. We don't have universally accepted treatment for. And then we need to, there's two arguments, right? One argument is we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let's open up the economy. The other argument is stop placing money over human lives. And let's shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision. And let's figure out some way to develop some sort of universal basic income plan or something like that to feed people during this time where we make this transition. I think there's a nuance. Yeah, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants to stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn't want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That's my opinion. And if somebody doesn't like that, well, that's my opinion. So now, yeah, this notion, though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true, obviously. Some people have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of planty. Do you think that- Like, it just makes stuff. Stuff, you know, there's a magic horn of planty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of planty and then if, like, if somebody has more stuff than somebody else's, it's because they took more from this magic horn of planty.

We'll run out of the stores, run out of the, you know, the machine just grinds to a halt. But the initial thought on this virus, the real fear was that this was gonna kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people instantaneously in this country. It was gonna do it very quickly. If we didn't hunker down, if we didn't shelter in place, if we didn't quarantine ourselves or lock down, do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be? Maybe, I think, briefly. Briefly. Briefly, but I think if, you know, any kind of, like, sensible examination of what happened in China would lead to the conclusion that that is obviously not gonna occur. This virus originated in Wuhan. There was like, I don't know, 100,000 people a day leaving Wuhan. So it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world. And the fatality rate was low. Don't you think, though, it's difficult to appreciate? It's difficult to filter the information that's coming out of China, to accurately really get a real true representation of what happened. The propaganda machine is very strong. Sure. What the World Health Organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda. Sure. Well, the thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China, like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers, like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they have issues or not. Then China is back at full steam. And many, pretty much every US company has some significant numbers of supplies in China. So you know if they're able to provide things or not, or if there's high mortality rate. Tesla has like welds 10,000 people in China. So zero people died. Mmmm. That's a real statistic. That's coming from, yeah. Yeah, you know those people. Yeah, you know those people. We literally were in peril. Do you think there's a danger of this? Do you think there's a danger of this? Same folks are there? Yeah, still there. Do you think there's a danger of politicizing. becomes like opening up the country is Donald Trump's it's his goal it's his and then anything he does is sort of there's there's people that are gonna oppose it and come up with some reasons why he's wrong particularly in this climate whereas as we're leading up to November and you know the 2020 elections do you think that this is a real danger in terms of public's perception that Trump wants to open it up so they need jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump there yeah I think there has been some well doesn't this has been politicized you know both directions really so it's which of which is not great yeah but like said separate apart from that I think there's the question of like you know where does civil liberties fit in this picture you know yeah and what what can the government make you do what can they make you not do and what you know what's okay. Right. Yeah, right. Yeah, I think we went too far. Do you think it's one of those things where once we've gone in a certain direction, it's very difficult to make a correction, make an adjustment to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing. It's not good, but it's not what we feared. So let's back up and reconsider, and let's do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially, that information appears to be faulty. And here's how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country was founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom that we respect and appreciate. Absolutely. Well, I think we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country. It's gonna happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. So yeah, something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting sort of COVID cases to separate out diagnosed with COVID versus had COVID like symptoms. Yes. Because the list of symptoms that could be COVID at this point is like a mile long. So it's like hard to, if you're ill at all, it's like it could be COVID.

We're conflating those two. Yes. So it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was COVID a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has COVID, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has COVID, it's gonna get recorded as a COVID death. Is that real? I mean, basically. Not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes. Get hit by a bus. Cancer. I mean, basically. Not cancer. If you get hit by a bus, go to the hospital and die. And then find that you have COVID, you will be recorded as a COVID death. Why would they do that though? Well, right now, so the road to hell is paid with good intentions. I mean, it's mostly paid with bad intentions, but there is some good intentions paving zones in there too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overrun with COVID patients created an incentive to record something as COVID that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital is going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So the hospitals are in a bind right now. There's a bunch of hospitals, they're following doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital is half full, you're, it's hard to make ends meet. So now you've got like, you know, I just checked this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back, or I got to fire some doctors. So this is a tough moral quandary. It's like, what are you gonna do? That's the situation we have. What's the way out of this? What do you think is like, if you had the president's ear or if people wanted to just listen to you openly, what do you think is the way out of this? Let's clear up the data, clear up the data. So, like I said, something should be recorded as COVID, only if it is somebody that's been tested, has received a positive COVID test, not if they simply have symptoms, one of like 100 symptoms. And then if it is a COVID death, it must be separated. Or was this, was COVID a primary reason for death? Or did they also have stage three cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by a bus? And had COVID. I've read all this stuff about that, about them diagnosing people as a COVID death, despite other variables. This is not a question. This is what is occurring. And where are you reading this from? Where are you getting this from? The public health officials have literally said this. This is not a question mark. Right. But this is unprecedented, right? Like if someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack. Yes. Yeah, so this is unprecedented. Is this because this is such a popular, I don't want to use that word the wrong way, but that's what I mean, a popular subject and financial incentives. Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of moral indictment of sort of hospital administrators. It's just, they're in a tough spot here. They actually don't have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff and potentially going bankrupt. So then they're like, okay, well, the stimulus bill says if we get all this money, if we say, if it's a COVID death, I'm like, okay. They coughed before they died. Yeah. In fact, they're not even diagnosed as COVID. They simply, if you had weakness, a cough, a shortness of breath. Frankly, I'm not sure how you die without those things. Yeah. Right, there's so many different things that you could attribute to COVID too. There's so many symptoms. There's diarrhea, headaches, dehydration, cough. Yes, but to be clear, you don't even need to have gotten a COVID diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it's COVID. So then it makes the death count look very high and then we're then stuck in a vine because it looks like the death count's super high and not going down like it should be. And now, so then we should keep whatever, the shelter in place stuff there and keep people in their home, confine people to homes. So we need to get break out of this. We're stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information.

But here we are, May and May, people are relaxing a little bit. They're realizing like, hey, I actually know a couple of people that got it. It was just a cough and I know some people that got it where nothing happened. Yes, I know a lot of people who got it. I know zero people who died. I mean, I know a lot of people who got it. Yeah, it's not what we feared. We feared something much worse. That's correct. So the adjustment is difficult to make. So you said, first of all, we need real data. Just parse out the data. Don't lump it all together. And if you give people, just parse out the data better, clear information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis? Or was it a, did they get the test? And the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out. And then parse out just, if somebody died, did they die? Did they even have a COVID test? Or did they just have one of many symptoms? Like, how do you die without weakness? I don't know. Right, of course. Basically, if you're gonna die, you're gonna have shortness of breath, weakness, and you might cough a little. So was it quantified? Yeah, that person, did they actually have a COVID test? And the tests come back positive. And then if they died, did they die where COVID was? It doesn't have to be the main course, but it was a significant contributor to their death. Or was it not a significant contributor to their death? No, I don't know. Right, of course. It's impossible. It's as simple as just because you had COVID, COVID killed you. Is it definitely not? Right. Yeah. I mean, people die all the time, and they have flu and other colds, and we don't say that they died of those flu and other colds. Yes. Well, that's what's so weird about this. It's so popular, and I use that word in a weird way, but it's so popular that we've kind of forgotten. People die pneumonia every day. People die of, the flu didn't take a break. Oh, COVID's got this. I'm going to sit this one out. I'm going to be on the bench. I'm going to wait until COVID's done before I jump back into the game of killing people. No, the flu's still here killing people. It's absurd. Yeah. Every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu. Yeah. Not tangentially. Right. Not every... Yeah, 61,000 in this country last year. Yeah, and we're only 5% of the world. And then there's cigarettes. So, oh man, cigarettes, not cigarettes will really kill you. That's a weird one, right? We're terrified of this disease that were projected could potentially kill 100, if not 200,000 Americans this year with cigarettes killed 500,000. And you don't hear a peep out of any politician. There's no one running for Congress that's trying to ban cigarettes. There's no one running for Senate that wants to put some education plan in place that's going to stop cigarettes in their tracks.

I'm not sure the exact number, but I believe until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs. Because... Wow. Basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially, it causes liver failure. Oh.

So it's like how many life years were lost is probably the right metric to use. Yeah. Yeah. I don't read my own comments, but I do read other people's comments and I was reading this one little Twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that COVID takes an average of 10 years off people's lives and we should appreciate those 10 years. And then someone else said, I'm sure it's not true. It's the Twitter. Oh my God, but someone else said the average age of people who die from COVID is older than the average age. People die. Yeah, definitely. It's the Twitter. It's very, let's say just say it's like, it's, it's about the same. That's a beautiful way of looking at it. I mean, it's, it's unfortunate. It sucks, but it sucks if grandpa dies of Alzheimer's or emphysema or leukemia. It sucks. Sure. It sucks when someone you love dies. Yes. I mean, actually if, if this, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that if, if you have, you know, grandparents and their age of grandparents, really be careful with, with, with, you know, any kind of flu or cold or something that, that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to, to the elderly is it basically, if you're kids got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents no matter what it is. It's, it's the things that are, where a young immune system is, has no problem and older one has, has a problem. And in fact, a lot of the, a lot of the deaths are just are literally, it's tragic, but they're, they're intra-family and it's the, you know, the little, little kid had a, had a, you know, cold or flu. Give it to grandpa. Yeah. It's a family gathering and they don't know that this is a big deal, but it's, it's just important to remember when you get old, your, your immune system is just not that strong. And so just be, be careful with your, with your, you know, loved ones or elderly. Give it to grandpa. Yeah. Yeah. And I think there is some true objective understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system, and I really think that that, that information should be, that should be distributed in a way, a non-judgmental way. But like, look, this is, this is a way that we can all, like this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones. And maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and, and people that are vulnerable, you know, vitamin C, heat shock proteins, all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system. Yeah, actually just, a thing that is tough, like when you, as you get older, it's hard to be, you tend to put on weight. You know, I certainly, that's happening with me. You know, like as an older I get, I'm like damn, it's harder to stay lean, that's for sure. And so actually being overweight is a big deal. Yeah. It's just a fact, well, yeah.

That's correct. It is, that's, yes, exactly. But it's also, we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people's feelings. Yeah, absolutely. We don't wanna bring up the fact that being fat's bad for you. It's a judgment on your. The food's great. Yeah, I do love food. Yeah, absolutely. We don't want, yeah. Yeah, and I mean, to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I'd rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life. Yeah, those moments of enjoying a great meal. Yeah. And then even talking about it, they're valuable. They're worth something. Yeah, it's not, we don't wanna eat Soylent Green and live to be 160. No, I don't wanna eat, tasty food is great. It's one of the best things about life. It's one of the best things about life. It really is, yeah. It's an art form as well. It's like fine food. It's a delicious sand castle. It's temporary, it doesn't last very long, but there's something about it that's very pleasing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine food. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I don't know what advice to give. Like, maybe smaller, have tasty food with smaller amounts of it. Yes, yes, yeah. And I think regulated feeding window's really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach. Sure. When I started doing that, I found myself to be quite a bit healthier. When I've deviated from that, I've gained weight. I think, 16 hours, well, like 16 hours, yeah. So like at night or? Yeah, yeah, yeah, 16 hours. Well, like 16 hours, yeah. So like at night or? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I get to a certain point and then I count out, I usually hit the stopwatch on my phone and then I look at 15 hours in, I'm like, okay, got an hour before I can eat. And so anything in between that is just water or coffee. Actually, yeah, actually, you know, like this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. And it can actually cause a heartburn that you don't even know is happening. And that subtle heartburn affects your sleep because you're horizontal and your body's digesting. So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and, you know, be healthier, it's do not eat right before we go to sleep. It's like one of the worst things you could do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have some of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. I've done that particularly after comedy shows, starving, try to come home and I'll eat. And then I go to bed and I just feel like, shit, and I wake up in the middle of the night. It's gonna, it's gonna crush your sleep and it's gonna damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus and it's so, in fact, drinking and then going to sleep, is that's one of the worst things you could do. Yes, yeah. So just try to avoid drinking and eating. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, don't, you know, it's gonna. Yes, yeah, exactly, don't, small amounts of alcohol that evidence suggests it's not, it doesn't have a negative effect on it. I put in the same category as delicious food. It kind of makes things a little more fun. Yeah, yeah. I like it. Yeah, yeah. I like it. I mean, some of the people who've lived the longest, you know, there was a woman in France who I think maybe has the record or close to it and she had a glass of wine every day, every day, you know. Yeah. Small, small amounts is fine. Yeah. But yeah, this is like, I learned this quite late in life. It's like just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep and your quality of life, your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot. For sure, yeah. This is, it's a big deal and I think not widely known. For sure, yeah. Do you have time to exercise? A little bit. Do you have a trainer or anything? I do, although I haven't seen him for a while, but yeah, especially if I'm out like, you know, say working on a starship or something in South Texas and I'm just living in my, ", "seq_num": 2, "video_id": null, "episode_title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk", "guest": "Elon Musk", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8", "date_posted": "2020-05-07T13:00:07Z", "Topics": ["The importance of enjoying food", "The negative effects of eating and drinking before bed", "The benefits of intermittent fasting"]}, {"text": "I've got a little house there in Boca Chica village. You know, I don't have much to do so. Or like I'm working and I'll just lift some weights or something, you know. Maybe, like I don't, some people love running. I don't love running. But if I- What do you like to do exercise wise? Um, to be totally frank, I wouldn't exercise at all if I could, but if I, I'd prefer not to exercise, but if I'm gonna exercise and lift some weights and then kind of run on the treadmill and maybe watch a show that, you know, if there's a compelling show that like pulls you in. Right, right, right, yeah. I know, no. That's a good thing to do, yeah. Right, right, right, yeah. That's a good thing to do. Watch a good movie or- Yeah, yeah. Episode of Black Mirror or something like that is great. Yeah, yeah. Episode of Black- Don't watch Black Mirror before we down a bed either. Well don't watch Black Mirror today. It's too fucking accurate. Yeah, exactly. It's like wait, this already happened in real life. Yeah, they're just too close. It's too close. Well, even didn't Jamie. Didn't you say that the the guy who makes black mirror? Yeah, he said he it's not a good time to start season six. Yeah. Yeah He wants to hold off because his reality nailed it is black mirror. Oh, it's like he's gonna have to like reassess And attack it from a different angle. Yeah, you should try something. That's fun to do That's not just like like learn a martial art or something like that. It's a reality Yeah, I did martial arts when I was a kid. Did you wish to? I Did Taekwondo I did karate kakushinkai. All right, cool and judo Did you wish to? Cool. I'll say you really branched out. Yeah. Yeah so And did Brazilian jujitsu briefly did you yeah where I'm in Palo Alto where really? Yeah, I don't know shit. I was gonna suggest that that's a great thing for people Like that's a thing about jujitsu if you look at it from the outside you think oh a bunch of meathead strangling each other But there's some of the smartest people I know or jujitsu fiends because they they get They first of all they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense Sure, but then they realize that it's essentially like a language with your body like you're having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language and It's really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are sure the the more you'll succeed In these ventures. That's really also an accurate analogy of what you just do is Yeah, I mean I kind of got I mean probably like a lot of people For the way early day the first MMA fights in hoist Gracie. Mm-hmm. And he's like incredible. It's like it's like Technique. Yeah. Yeah, he was like, you know winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing It was just like this is cool Like it's like like you know, this is cool It was what martial arts were supposed to be when we were kids Yeah, when you saw Bruce Lee fuck up all these big giant guys like wow How martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you, right? Most of the time that's not real especially if they know martial arts Yes, but in the UFC when hoist Gracie off of his back was strangling Dan Severn with his legs Yeah, holy shit Yeah This guy's being pinned by this big giant wrestler and he wraps his legs around his neck Chokes him to the point the guy has to surrender. Yeah, amazing. Yeah. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, it was amazing I mean hoist got beaten up pretty bad in some of those. He did. Well, he definitely has some rough fights, but he won Yeah, he's a legend and but what it showed and I mean, I'm a huge lover of jiu-jitsu what it showed is that there is a method for for defusing these situations with technique and knowledge. Yeah, and I think it's also a great way to exercise too because It's almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing though the exercises like you want like and you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing and the analogy that I use is like if you imagine if you had a race car and You could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower.

It really is. Yeah, it seems like a good, yes. Yeah. When am I gonna be able to buy one of them Roadsters? When's that happening? Well, I can't say exactly when, but we gotta get it, you know, this COVID thing's kinda throwing us for a loop. I'm sure. So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it certainly set us back on progress for some number of months. I'm sure. I mean, the things we gotta get done ahead of Roadster are, you know, ramping up Model Y production. That'll be a great, great car. It is a great car. Getting the Berlin Gigafactory built and also building Y, expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great. And get the, you know, the Cybertruck, Cybertruck, Semi-Truck, Roadster. Roadster's kinda like dessert. So, like, we gotta get the, you know, wheat and potatoes and greens and stuff, you know, like. But Roadster comes before Cybertruck. I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster. Interesting. I'm not mad at that. Some of the things for Roadster, they're, you know, the tri-motor, a Plaid powertrain. We're gonna have that in Model S. So that's, like, one of the ingredients that's needed for Roadster is the Plaid powertrain, the more advanced, you know, battery back, that kind of thing. I'm not mad at that. I wanted to ask you about this before I forgot. There's a company that's called Apex that's taking your Teslas and they're giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension. Sure. How do you feel about that? Do you work with them? That sounds good to me. Are you cool with those people? Yeah, I mean, I'm all for highdy, go ahead. They're jazbin' stuff up, with carbon fiber and doin' a bunch of interior choices. You're cool with, you can't fuck with that. You don't have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has, like, a sort of specialty operation? Yeah, I got no problem. That's what's it called, right? It's like, JAYMAC, is it called Apex? Yeah, I got no problem. It has, like, a sort of specialty operation. Yeah, I got no phone. That's what it's called. Yeah, I got a Unplug Performance as Apex. That's right, Unplug Performance, yeah. Yeah, you could, for sure, Unplugged performance, yeah. Yeah, you could for sure lighten the car up and improve to tire traction. Have you seen that company's stuff? What they do? I don't know specifically, but it's pretty dope. They make it pretty dope looking. They take Model S and they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. That's it right there. Cool. Ooh, la la, look at that. That looks pretty nice. Yeah, it does. Now, the Plaid version of the Model S, are you going to widen the track and do a bunch of different things? I know you guys are testing at the Nurburgring. Can you not talk about that? Yeah, it looks pretty. Well, I think we got to leave that for like a proper sort of product unveil. I understand. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. I understand. Last time you were here, you convinced me to buy a Tesla. I bought it and it's fucking insane. Oh, great. Glad you like it. Ah, man. Pretty fun. It's not just pretty fun. It's like the way I've described it is it makes other cars seem stupid. They just seem dumb. I love dumb things. I love dumb cars. I love campfires. I love campfires. I have a 1993 Porsche that's air cooled. It's not that fast. It's really slow compared to the Tesla. Yeah, it's really quite slow. But there's something engaging about the mechanical, just like the gears and it's very analog. But it's so stupid in comparison to the Tesla. Like when I want to go somewhere in the Model S, I hit the gas and it just goes, whee! It just violates time. Oh, great. Glad you like it. Ah, man. Pretty fun. I love campfires. Tesla. Really so. It's really quite slow. But just something. Yeah, you've tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah, cool. Cool. Oh, yeah. We just did a software update where it'll do a cheetah stance. So, yeah, because it's got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, cool. Cool. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, just like a sprinter, basically. Like what do you do if you're a sprinter? You hunker down and then... So, I shaved like a tenth of a second off the 0.60. I mean, like, you know, it's pretty fun. It's so, I've taken so many people and I'm like, I take them for the holy shit moment. I'm like, are you ready? Like, hang on there. Then I stomp on the gas, then I stomp on the gas. Then I've never felt anything like it. It's confusing. Yeah. It really is. Sure. The instant torque, the instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling. Sure. It's baffling. It's baffling. They've never felt it. No. It's faster than falling. It's crazy. It's so fast. It's a roller coaster. Yeah. And my family yells at me when I stomp the gas like I tell my kids, I'm like, do you want to feel it? You want to feel it? Do it, do it, do it. My wife's like, don't do it. Boom! What! Yeah. And even if I just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, it's very exciting. It's very fun. It's like having a... Boom! What! What! Yeah, that's very fun. It's very it's like having a roller coaster on tap. You know it really is like a roller coaster on top Yeah, without the loop-de-loops, but it's the the pinning to your seat It seems like you're not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a can you know a consumer vehicle that you can Just a regular person could buy if you have the money it seems too too crazy And then the idea this roadster is a half of a second faster than that Yeah, that's madness. Well if that roads with the roadster. We're gonna do some things that are kind of unfair, so We're gonna take some things from like You know from kind of like rocket rocket world and put them on a car so oh, I read about that explain that like What do you well like I said? We can't okay unveil right here, but but it's gonna do some things that aren't fair, and then They're the the the where we do the unveil the roadster let me just say that anyone who's been waiting They won't be sorry It's they won't be sorry Sure well anything that goes 0 to 60 was it 1.9. Is that the zero 60? That's the base model. That's What's the top of the food chain model? Okay? Okay? Faster than that just say faster than that yeah that seems so crazy to me now What was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window, and they were supposed to not break and it broke okay? Okay, you know faster than that. Let's just say faster than that well Yeah, I know Are you know you know that our demos are authentic? So I was not expecting that and I and then I think I muttered under my breath Yeah Yeah, you didn't get mad though. No. You didn't Steve Jobs it No, I I definitely swore but you know I didn't think the mic could pick it up, but it did and but it's so Like we practiced this you know by in the scenes yeah Tesla we don't do we don't do like tons of practice for for our demos because we Work, we're working on the cars like we you know we're building new technologies and and improving the fundamental product So we're not spending it like doing like hundreds of you know practice things or anything like that. We don't have time for that but the Just hours before that the demo Both Franz you know is that head of design and I were in the studio at the thrown steel balls at the window I was bouncing right off. I'm like okay. This seems pretty good seems like we got it, okay and then we think what happened was that when we When Franz hit the the the door wit", "seq_num": 2, "video_id": null, "episode_title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk", "guest": "Elon Musk", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8", "date_posted": "2020-05-07T13:00:07Z", "Topics": ["Jiu-jitsu", "Tesla Roadster", "Tesla Model Y", "Berlin Gigafactory", "Shanghai factory", "Cybertruck", "Semi-Truck", "Apex company", "Unplug Performance", "Model S", "Nurburgring testing", "Tesla Model S"]}, {"text": "h the sledgehammer you know so sure like like this is this is like exoskeleton ", "seq_num": 2, "video_id": null, "episode_title": "The Joe Rogan Experience #1470 - Elon Musk", "guest": "Elon Musk", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8", "date_posted": "2020-05-07T13:00:07Z", "Topics": ["Explanation of the sledgehammer and exoskeleton"]}, {"text": "You know high-strength hardened steel you can literally Take wind up with a sledgehammer.
