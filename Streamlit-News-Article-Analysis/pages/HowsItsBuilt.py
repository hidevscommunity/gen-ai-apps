Given the textual data of a News article, we want to build a üèóÔ∏è

üìã I've Structed the LLM to complete 3 Major Tasks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Supply Chain Disruption Event Classifier 
   - Classify if the News article talks about an event that will potentially affect the supply chain industry üì¶üåê

2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract location --> Geopy API get coordinates üó∫Ô∏è

3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Attributes:
   - Disruption Type (E.g. Geo-political, Flooding) üåäüåç
   - Severity Metrics üìä
   - Estimated Radius of Impact üåéüìè

Each Task is comprised into a "Chain"
