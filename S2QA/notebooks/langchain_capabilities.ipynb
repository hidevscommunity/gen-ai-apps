Worldwide, many vaccines were introduced to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to compare the bio-pharmacological characteristics, indications, contraindications, efficacy, and adverse effects of inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm, CoronaVac, and Covaxin. Initially, 262 documents and 6 international organizations were selected. Finally, 41 articles, fact sheets, and international organizations were included. The data were recorded from the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) USA, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. The results demonstrated that these three inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm, CoronaVac, and Covaxin, received emergency approval from the FDA/WHO, and all three of these vaccines are beneficial for the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sinopharm vaccine has been recommended during pregnancy and for people of all age groups, and the CoronaVac and Covaxin vaccines are recommended for people over 18 years of age and older. These three vaccines have recommended intramuscular doses of 0.5 mL each, with a 3–4 week interval. These three vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator at +2 to +8 °C. The common adverse effects of these vaccines are pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue, headache, myalgias, general lethargy, body ache, arthralgia, nausea, chills, fever, and dizziness. The overall mean efficiency for the prevention of the COVID-19 disease is 73.78% for Sinopharm, 70.96% for CoronaVac, and 61.80% for Covaxin. In conclusion, all three inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm, CoronaVac, and Covaxin, are beneficial for the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evidence suggests that the overall impact of Sinopharm is slightly better than that of CoronaVac and Covaxin.', metadata={'title': 'Comparison of Biological, Pharmacological Characteristics, Indications, Contraindications, Efficacy, and Adverse Effects of Inactivated Whole-Virus COVID-19 Vaccines Sinopharm, CoronaVac, and Covaxin: An Observational Study', 'venue': 'Vaccines', 'year': 2023, 'paperId': '80124eb218cd57f3084b15b7eb6cb29e26887677', 'citationCount': 0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/11/4/826/pdf?version=1681188618', 'authors': ['S.

The safety and efficacy of currently available Covid-19 vaccines have been demonstrated in few studies; however, further information on specific high-risk groups like the elderly with co-morbidities is needed. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to compare the adverse side effects of two different Covid-19 vaccines (RNA-based Pfizer/BioNTech and inactivated CoronaVac) among the elderly with co-morbidities. \\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected a total of 800 participants 65 years or older who received either one of the vaccines. We collected data on the possible side effects that have been previously attributed to coronavirus vaccination via quantitative telephone interviews.\\nRESULTS: We found that both CoronaVac and Pfizer/BioNTech were safe in adults over 65 years old, even with co-morbidities. The most common side effects were pain on the injection site and fatigue. Adverse effects, particularly allergic reactions, were higher in Pfizer/BioNTech vaccinated group compared to the CoronaVac group.\\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, even with co-morbidities, both vaccines were well-tolerated among the elderly.

On June 18, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued separate interim recommendations for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6 months-5 years and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6 months-4 years for the prevention of COVID-19.* Both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines met the criteria for immunobridging, which is the comparison of neutralizing antibody levels postvaccination in young children with those in young adults in whom efficacy had been demonstrated. Descriptive efficacy analyses were also conducted for both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines during the period when the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) predominated. No specific safety concerns were identified among recipients of either vaccine. ACIP recommendations for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6 months-5 years and 6 months-4 years, respectively, are interim and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

In the early stage of the disease, fever, fatigue, dry cough is the main clinical manifestations. About half of the patients developed dyspnea more than one week later, and the severe cases rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is important because of the impact and damage caused by the virus worldwide.

Nonetheless, concerns surrounding the efficacy and potential adverse effects of these vaccines have become prevalent among the public. To date, there has been a paucity of research investigating public perceptions and the adoption of COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, the present study endeavours to address this lacuna by undertaking a spatiotemporal analysis of sentiments towards vaccination and its uptake in England at the local authority level, while concurrently examining the sociodemographic attributes at the national level. Methods A sentiment analysis of Twitter data was undertaken to delineate the distribution of positive sentiments and their demographic correlates. Positive sentiments were categorized into clusters to streamline comparison across different age and gender demographics. The relationship between positive sentiment and vaccination uptake was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Additionally, a bivariate analysis was carried out to further probe public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines and their local adoption rates. Result The results indicated that the majority of positive tweets were posted by males, although females expressed higher levels of positive sentiment. The age group over 40 dominated the positive tweets and exhibited the highest sentiment polarity. Additionally, vaccination uptake was positively correlated with the number of positive tweets and the age group at the local authority level. Conclusion Overall, public opinions on COVID-19 vaccines are predominantly positive. The number of individuals receiving vaccinations at the local authority level is positively correlated with the prevalence of positive attitudes towards vaccines, particularly among the population aged over 40. These findings suggest that targeted efforts to increase vaccination uptake among younger populations, particularly males, are necessary to achieve widespread vaccination coverage.', metadata={'title': 'Exploring public sentiment and vaccination uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in England: a spatiotemporal and sociodemographic analysis of Twitter data', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Public Health', 'year': 2023, 'paperId': '5ee9314a6d216ccc38a00a574deb3dac83a5feec', 'citationCount': 0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1193750/pdf', 'authors': ['T.

Dialysis patients exhibit increased COVID-19-related incidence rates and mortality due to poor immune responses. We studied retrospectively the efficacy of 6 different COVID-19 vaccines as well as the combination of vaccines for the prevention of new COVID-19 infections and related mortality in a large multi-national hemodialysis cohort.\\n \\n \\n \\n All patients from 22 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, 18 years or older, registered within in the network of a multi-national dialysis provider on January 31st 2021, were included into the study. We analyzed the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in HD patients with vaccination status after 2 doses of 6 different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in comparison to HD patients who did not receive any vaccine. Patients were screened for COVID-19 symptoms at each dialysis visit and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed in all symptomatic patients. All PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infections, and deaths occurring between January 31st, and July 15th, 2021 were analyzed. Results were stratified by vaccine type and compared to unvaccinated patients. Data are presented as incidence rate ratios per 1000 patient days and odds ratios vs. no vaccine (95% CI).\\n \\n \\n \\n Of 38342 eligible patients registered on the index date, 2413 were excluded due to a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR within 3 months before baseline and 26 were excluded due to unclear vaccination data. The remaining 35903 patients were analyzed. 7816 patients (21.7%) had received a single vaccine dose and 18853 patients (52.5%) had received two doses of any COVID-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria 3180 and 1321, Comirnaty 2823 and 13116, Spikevax 185 and 1521, Sputnik V 1194 and 432, Sinovac 266 and 1722, Sinopharm 168 and 416, or any combination of two different vaccines 325). The 9119 patients (25.4%) who remained unvaccinated during the observational period showed an incidence rate of 0.74/1000 patient days. In the cohort of patients vaccinated two times, 232 developed Covid-19. The lowest incidence rate ratio was observed in patients that had received Spikevax 0.06 (0.02-0.14). By contrast, patients after Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Sputnik V exhibited highest incidence rate ratios 0.53 (0.21-1.09), 0.46 (0.34-0.61), 0.68 (0.34-1.23), respectively. The largest sub-cohort of 13116 patients, who had received Comirnaty, however, had an incidence rate ratio of 0.15 (0.12-0.17).

Although the safety profiles of vaccines have been proved, there still remain gaps between healthy individuals and patients with autoimmune diseases in the efficacy and adverse events of vaccinations.The aim of theCOVID-19 andInfluenzaVaccineInLupus (CIVIL) study was to compare the perception and safety profile between COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine in Korean patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).We conducted a cross-sectional study based on a 34-question web-based survey on COVID-19 and influenza vaccination in 207 medically confirmed SLE patients. Patients were recruited from 13 academic hospitals affiliated with Korean society of SLE research (KSSR) from DEC 2022 to JAN 2023. The primary outcome was the perception of patients and physicians on the vaccines, and the occurrence of side effects including flare.94.1% of two hundred respondents were females aged in 20’s (19.8%), 30’s (24.3%), 40’s (27.7%), 50’s (16.8%), and 52% was treated more than 10 years. More than 50% of patients were in stable condition for recent 6 months (below 20mm in 100mm visual analogue scale with lower than 10mg prednisolone equivalent dose). COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax) and influenza vaccine were completed in 77.7% and 87.6% of SLE patients, respectively. Reasons for willing not vaccinated included fear of lupus flare (56.3% vs 24.5%), worried about side effects (52.1% vs 26.6%), and not recommended from physicians (35.4% vs 7.4%) on COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) occurred much higher in COVID-19 vaccine (65.8%) than influenza vaccine (12.4%). However, only 4.4% of patients experiencing AEs from COVID-19 vaccine required hospitalization. Most common AEs were pain/redness on injection site, myalgia and/or arthralgia, fatigue, febrile sense, irregularity in menstrual period. 10.3% of patients taking COVID-19 vaccine experienced lupus flare (arthralgia, skin rash, hair loss, and deterioration of proteinuria/laboratory parameter), which lead to medication change or hospitalization.COVID-19 vaccine has a worse perception and higher adverse events compared to influenza vaccine in Korean SLE patients.[1]COVID-19 vaccination-related adverse events among autoimmune disease patients: results from the COVAD study.

       " Document(page_content='Deciphering the Role of Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Different COVID-19 Vaccines—A Comparison of Vaccine Candidate Genes in Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters;\\n ABSTRACT:With the exception of inactivated vaccines, all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently used for clinical application focus on the spike envelope glycoprotein as a virus-specific antigen. Compared to other SARS-CoV-2 genes, mutations in the spike protein gene are more rapidly selected and spread within the population, which carries the risk of impairing the efficacy of spike-based vaccines. It is unclear to what extent the loss of neutralizing antibody epitopes can be compensated by cellular immune responses, and whether the use of other SARS-CoV-2 antigens might cause a more diverse immune response and better long-term protection, particularly in light of the continued evolution towards new SARS-CoV-2 variants. To address this question, we explored immunogenicity and protective effects of adenoviral vectors encoding either the full-length spike protein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N), the receptor binding domain (RBD) or a hybrid construct of RBD and the membrane protein (M) in a highly susceptible COVID-19 hamster model. All adenoviral vaccines provided life-saving protection against SARS-CoV-2-infection. The most efficient protection was achieved after exposure to full-length spike. However, the nucleocapsid protein, which triggered a robust T-cell response but did not facilitate the formation of neutralizing antibodies, controlled early virus replication efficiently and prevented severe pneumonia. Although the full-length spike protein is an excellent target for vaccines, it does not appear to be the only option for future vaccine design.', metadata={'title': 'Deciphering the Role of Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Different COVID-19 Vaccines—A Comparison of Vaccine Candidate Genes in Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters', 'venue': 'Viruses', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '645712b5f5fca1a8cdbfd8c88e19f91b7a14f50d', 'citationCount': 6, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/11/2290/pdf?version=1637116845', 'authors': ['J.

DESIGN Systematic review of studies that have considered impacts of vaccines in relation to baseline risks. Calculation of risk reduction and harms from published data in two random controlled trials and one population-based implementation study. Analysis of risk reductions in geographical areas with varying baseline risks. Comparison of results concerning COVID-19 vaccine and selected prior vaccines. SETTING Random controlled trials of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in multiple countries; population-based study using Pfizer vaccine in Israel. Counties with varying baseline risks in the United States; states with varying baseline risks in India. PARTICIPANTS 43,448 and 30,420 subjects in the random controlled trials; 1,198,236 subjects in the population-based study. INTERVENTIONS Multi-site random controlled trials of vaccine efficacy; population-based administration of vaccine with determination of effectiveness by comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to be vaccinated to prevent one symptomatic infection (NNV), absolute risk of the intervention (ARI), and number needed to harm (NNH). RESULTS A systematic review of literature in medicine and public health showed very few reports regarding ARR, NNV, ARI, and NNH; use of these indicators to compare benefits versus harms; or analysis of these EBM indicators in the context of varying baseline risks. From data in the two random controlled trials and one population-based study, calculated ARR was approximately 1 percent (as compared to RRR of 50 to 95 percent), and NNV was in the range of 100 to 500. In comparisons of ARR and NNV versus ARI and NNH, benefits and harms were not markedly different. From a sensitivity analysis of ARR and NNV in population groups with varying baseline risks, the effectiveness of vaccines as measured by ARR and NNV was substantially higher in regions with high as compared to low baseline risks. The ARR for COVID-19 vaccines was somewhat smaller and the NNV somewhat larger than achieved by some vaccines to prevent influenza and smallpox. CONCLUSION The efficacy and effectiveness of major COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by RRR, are impressive. As measured by ARR and NNV, which take into account variation in baseline risks, the effectiveness of the vaccines is substantially higher in areas with higher baseline risks. This finding can contribute to educational efforts, informed consent procedures, and policy making about priorities for vaccine distribution, especially under conditions of access barriers linked to poverty and inequality. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC Major COVID-19 vaccines so far have shown impressive efficacy in random controlled trials and effectiveness in population-based studies. To determine efficacy and effectiveness, these studies have used relative risk reduction (RRR), which shows the difference in event rate between those receiving and not receiving a vaccine. Reports of efficacy and effectiveness have not yet clarified other key indicators from evidence-based medicine (EBM) that consider variations baseline risks. Such indicators include measures of benefits such as absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to be vaccinated (NNV), as well as measures of harm such as absolute risk of the intervention (ARI) and number needed to harm (NNH). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS For COVID-19 vaccines, calculated ARR is somewhat lower and NNV somewhat higher than for certain prior vaccines such as those for influenza and smallpox. Indicators of harm for COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARI and NNH, appear to be in the same order of magnitude as indicators of benefit such as ARR and NNV. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARR and NNV, is substantially higher in geographical areas with high baseline risk, compared to areas with low baseline risk. These findings can assist in informed consent procedures, educational efforts, and priority setting in policies about distribution of vaccines, especially in the context of access barriers related to poverty and inequality.', metadata={'title': 'COVID-19 vaccines and evidence-based medicine', 'venue': 'medRxiv', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '03d6b34a1cf03123d690ea4ff173b0d47b72b2f7', 'citationCount': 1, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://ebm.bmj.com/content/ebmed/early/2022/03/27/bmjebm-2021-111789.full.pdf', 'authors': ['A.

The efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines have been evaluated in the general population; however, data on patients with malignancies are limited. METHODS This prospective longitudinal observational cohort study was conducted between June and July 2021. Enrolled adult patients with cancer were divided into chemotherapy and nonchemotherapy groups. All participants were immunized with two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccines. The primary outcome was a comparison of the immunogenicity (as assessed by spike protein [anti-S] immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody titers) of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the chemotherapy and nonchemotherapy groups. The secondary outcomes included the anti-S IgG seroconversion rate and vaccine safety in both groups. RESULTS Among the 173 enrolled patients with solid cancer, after COVID-19 vaccination, the chemotherapy group had a significantly lower median anti-S IgG titer than the nonchemotherapy group (26 v 237 U/mL, P < .001). A statistically significant difference in anti-S IgG titer was found between groups vaccinated with CoronaVac (7 v 90 U/mL, P < .001), but no difference was found in those vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (818 v 1061 U/mL, P = .075). The anti-S IgG seroconversion rate was significantly lower in the chemotherapy group than that in the nonchemotherapy group (78.9% v 96.5%, P = .001). No new or serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION Patients with solid cancer receiving a COVID-19 vaccine while undergoing chemotherapy had lower immunogenicity responses to vaccination than those who were vaccinated while undergoing nonchemotherapy treatment.

In these cases, as well as in patients with moderate/severe COVID-19, passive immunization with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins could be a therapeutic alternative. We used caprylic acid precipitation to prepare a pilot-scale batch of anti-SARS-CoV-2 intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) from plasma of donors immunized with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) anti-COVID-19 vaccine (VP-IVIg) and compared their in vitro efficacy and safety with those of a similar formulation produced from plasma of COVID-19 convalescent donors (CP-IVIg). Both formulations showed immunological, physicochemical, biochemical, and microbiological characteristics that meet the specifications of IVIg formulations. Moreover, the concentration of anti-RBD and ACE2-RBD neutralizing antibodies was higher in VP-IVIg than in CP-IVIg. In concordance, plaque reduction neutralization tests showed inhibitory concentrations of 0.03–0.09 g/L in VP-IVIg and of 0.06–0.13 in CP-IVIg. Thus, VP-IVIg has in vitro efficacy and safety profiles that justify their evaluation as therapeutic alternative for clinical cases of COVID-19. Precipitation with caprylic acid could be a simple, feasible, and affordable alternative to produce formulations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IVIg to be used therapeutically or prophylactically to confront the COVID-19 pandemic in middle and low-income countries.', metadata={'title': 'In vitro Characterization of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIg) Produced From Plasma of Donors Immunized With the BNT162b2 Vaccine and Its Comparison With a Similar Formulation Produced From Plasma of COVID-19 Convalescent Donors', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Medical Technology', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': 'e1bff5d76d474aef6d3f03a7ecd3f93027a13535', 'citationCount': 7, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmedt.2021.772275/pdf', 'authors': ['Gabriel Rojas-Jiménez', 'Daniela Solano', 'A.

Based on the longitudinal data on vaccination coverage and daily infection cases from fifty states in the United States from March to May 2021, causal analyses were conducted using structural nested mean models to estimate the population-level effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination program against infection with the original strain. We found that in the US, every 1% increase of vaccination coverage rate reduced the weekly growth rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases by 1.02% (95% CI: 0.26%, 1.69%), and the estimated population-level effectiveness of the COVID-19 program was 63.9% (95% CI: 18.0%, 87.5%). In comparison to a no-vaccination scenario, the COVID-19 vaccination campaign averted 8.05 million infections through the study period. Scenario analyses show that a vaccination program with doubled vaccination speed or with more rapid vaccination speed at the early stages of the campaign would avert more infections and increase vaccine effectiveness. The COVID-19 vaccination program demonstrated a high population-level effectiveness and significantly reduced the disease burden in the US. Accelerating vaccine rollout, especially at an early stage of the campaign, is crucial for reducing COVID-19 infections.', metadata={'title': 'Population-Level Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccination Program in the United States: Causal Analysis Based on Structural Nested Mean Model', 'venue': 'Vaccines', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': 'f23fad413391159bba78bc928aba1bc9b67ab93d', 'citationCount': 2, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/5/726/pdf?version=1652265172', 'authors': ['Rui Wang', 'Jiahao Wang', 'Taojun Hu', 'Xiaohua Zhou'], 'externalIds': {'PubMedCentral': '9144931', 'DOI': '10.3390/vaccines10050726', 'CorpusId': 248648787, 'PubMed': '35632481'}}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Efficacy and effectiveness of covid-19 vaccine - absolute vs. relative risk reduction;\\n ABSTRACT:Over the last few months, there has been a passionate debate within the scientific community on the risks and the benefits of the vaccines against COVID-19 disease. Reporting relative risk reduction (RRR), as usually done in phase 3 studies, does not consider the background risk of being infected and becoming ill with COVID-19, which varies between population and over time. For this reason, several researchers argued that the absolute risk reduction (ARR), namely the difference between attack rates with and without the vaccine, should also be reported [1,2]. The two indices, being conceptually different, are of different order of magnitude (Table 1) [3–10]; for example, the 95% RRR for BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine [3] corresponds to 0.85% ARR [1]. Using one of the two measures to estimate the risk/ benefit ratio would lead to different conclusions. We need to examine some points to use these indicators in an optimal way. Comparison with vaccines against other respiratory-borne viruses is likely to be of little use in interpreting these data. As an example, efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines are estimated on studies lasting the whole influenza season (5– 6 months), considerably longer than COVID-19 vaccine studies [11], and are tested in a completely different background situation, with no or limited use of mitigation procedures at population level (social distancing, use of face-masks). Both these elements, as we will see shortly, can substantially influence the effectiveness of vaccines as estimated by phase 3 trials. Actually, ARR and its derivative number needed to vaccinate to prevent a disease (NNV) are time-dependent parameters, affected by follow-up duration (Figure 1) [12]. The above mentioned fall of risk reduction indices of BNT162b2 vaccine could therefore be, at least in part, correlated to the very short duration of the study [3] (median value 2 months). A pivotal question is: how effective is a vaccine with 95% RRR in preventing COVID-19 in next years in a large population exposed to a long-lasting risk of infection? It may be useful to compare data of COVID-19 vaccines with those of other primary prevention studies in different fields of preventive medicine. Polypill (fixed doses of aspirin, statin and antihypertensive drugs given to large populations) is a strategy used to reduce cardiovascular disease burden in primary prevention, appointed of a number needed to treat (NNT) of 36– 57 to prevent an acute cardiovascular event in 5 years [13], a period 30 times longer than phase 3 studies on COVID-19 vaccines. Since survival event-free curves showed an approximately constant slope, we could therefore estimate that polypill had, in the first months of treatment, a NNT roughly around 1000, considerably higher than the NNV calculated for BNT162b2 vaccine during the phase 3 study (119) [3]. Needless to say that this is an oversimplified model and that many factors (in the case of vaccines, progressive reduction in the number of vulnerable subjects after vaccination or natural infection, immunity decline and emerging of new variants able to escape the vaccine) can modify the effectiveness of vaccine over time. Nevertheless, very recent papers reporting five to six-months update on BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 (ModernaNIH) vaccines [14,15], actually gives the measure of the dependence of ARR on the time of observation, showing an increase of ARR up to 3.7% and 4.9%, respectively (corresponding to NNVs of 27 and 21, respectively). Another relevant point is that ARR, unlike RRR, is not an intrinsic property of a drug or a vaccine, but it’s rather a predictor of the effectiveness of an intervention during the translation in the ‘real world,’ being the result of the interaction between that drug or vaccine (with its own efficacy expressed by RRR) and the baseline population risk. The relationship between the effectiveness of a preventive action and the baseline risk is well-known. For example, in the early 2000s the Seven Countries Study [16] showed that the relationship between blood pressure values and mortality for coronary heart disease had different slopes in different populations. In other words, the relationship between risk factor (hypertension) and the relative risk of death for ischemic heart disease was similar while the relationship with absolute risk was different across the populations studied. For that reason, the same intervention (blood pressure reduction of a given value) will give a different number of prevented events in different population, being the effectiveness higher the higher the slope of the relationship and, hence, baseline cardiovascular risk. The same is expected for vaccination against an infectious disease: the higher the viral circulation in the population (i.e. the infection rate), the higher the effectiveness (ARR) (Figure 1). In this regard, we have to take into account that the effect of COVID19 vaccines has been evaluated over a background of strict preventive measures at population level (social distancing, hand hygiene, mask wearing) that reduced significantly the', metadata={'title': 'Efficacy and effectiveness of covid-19 vaccine - absolute vs. relative risk reduction', 'venue': 'Expert Review of Vaccines', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': 'ee8aefb98a42d4a01a8537a97f98fddbb04fb400', 'citationCount': 5, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14760584.2022.2067531?needAccess=true', 'authors': ['C.

Public opinion surveys on vaccine hesitancy prompted our team to investigate Polish healthcare workers’ (HCWs) attitudes towards the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vaccinations. In-person and online surveys of HCWs: doctors, nurses, medical students, and other allied health professionals (n = 419) were conducted between 14 September 2020 and 5 November 2020. In our study, 68.7% of respondents would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations would persuade 86.3% of hesitant and those who would refuse to be vaccinated. 3.1% of all respondents claimed that no argument would convince them to get vaccinated. 61.6% of respondents declared a willingness to receive an influenza vaccination, of which 83.3% were also inclined to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. Although most respondents—62.5% (262/419) indicated they trusted in the influenza vaccine more, more respondents intended to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the 2020/2021 season.

Methods This was a retrospective case control study on the efficacy of BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine) and CoronaVac (inactivated whole virus vaccine) against COVID-19 in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. A total of 327 patients were included, with 109 patients infected with COVID-19 matched with 218 patients without COVID-19. The co-primary outcomes were vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related respiratory failure. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using the formula (1-adjusted odds ratio) x 100. Results Patients who received at least 2 doses of CoronaVac had lower risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 and developing respiratory failure than those who did not have vaccination, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.189 (95% CI = 0.050–0.714, p = 0.014) and 0.128 (95% CI = 0.026–0.638, p = 0.012) respectively. Patients who received at least 2 doses of BNT162b2 had lower risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 and developing respiratory failure than those who did not have vaccination with adjusted OR of 0.207 (95% CI = 0.043–0.962, p = 0.050) and 0.093 (95% CI = 0.011–0.827, p = 0.033) respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the risks of being hospitalized for COVID-19 and developing respiratory failure between patients who received at least 2 doses of CoronaVac or BNT162b2.

However clinical outcome in vaccinated persons is not widely known. This was a Questionnaire based study conducted between September 2021 to March 2022 after permission of IEC (Letter no. SNMC /IEC /2021 / 50). A Google doc based validated questionnaire (18 questions) was circulated through E mail/social media groups to individuals who became COVID infected in the past. The respondents who were fully vaccinated and completed 14 days duration after second dose of vaccination at time of infection serves as study group (Group I) while those who were unvaccinated at the time of infection serves as control group (Group II). Clinical course of disease was compared between two groups. A total of 517 previously COVID infected individuals had responded the questionnaire. Out of it, 108 respondents were either partially vaccinated or infected before completion of 14 days of second dose so they were excluded from the study. A total of 210 fully vaccinated respondents were included in study group (Group I) while 199 individuals who were unvaccinated at the time of infection serves as control group (Group II). Difficulty in breathing, need of hospital stay and post COVID complications were significantly less in vaccinated group in comparison to control group. As per survey findings, vaccination significantly reduces difficulty in breathing and need of hospital stay. A significant reduction in post COVID complications was also noted.

Safety assessment: side effect panel of the Paul-Ehrlich Institute reporting system of suspected side effects (analogue and digital): Comparison of reported side effects against 100000 immunization doses vs historical known medical events against 100000 patient years. Not much is known how long side effect reporting periode after MRNA / Vector immunization is appropiate for the different immunization drugs (Biontech/Pfizer-Comirnaty(2), AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, Moderna-Spikevax, Johnson&Johnson–Covid-19 vaccine Janssen) because for these no pharmacokinetic and –dynamic data (2,3) are available on spike protein biodistribution and how long it lasts in the human body. EMA / WHO guidelines declare these data not as essential for approval of vaccines, only for drugs (4).Real world safety and efficacy of Covid-19 immunizations.In 664 patients (612 patients with rheumatic diseases) planned standardized assessment: Safety parameters before and 3-7 days after immunization (organ, hematology, myositis, thrombosis, inflammatory, autoimmunity parameters), after 5-6 months (before booster decision) d-dimer-levels, routine lab assessment (routine surveillance of rheumatic patients under therapy) and Covid-19-antibody levels (AbL).Most patients (94.5%) developed Covid19-AbL (except a few under Abatacept and Rituximab). After 5-6 months most patients (77%) still had Covid19 sufficient AbL above 128 BAU/ml (87% above 64 BAU/ml) (1). 37% of all patients developed relevant elevated d-dimers (still 5-6 months after immunization). In most of these patients the suspicion of inflammation of the microvascular system was a reasonable explanation (large vessel or pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out in 98 %).Inflammation of the microvascular system as an underestimated side effect of MRNA / Vector immunization should be taken into account if (booster)-immunization decisions in patients with rheumatic diseases (maybe general) are to be made. Most patients with rheumatic diseases under (DMARD) therapy developed Covid-19 AbL (94.5%) (1) 5-6 months after MRNA / Vector immunization. All immunization decisions should also made dependent on AbL, because in case 5.5 % of immunized people do not react with AbL response, high numbers of breakthrough infection rates and hospitalization of immunized patients could be explained. Microvascular inflammation after MRNA / Vector immunization as a side effect in 37 % of rheumatologic patients could cause medical problems later on. Therefore also for safety reasons MRNA / Vector (booster) immunizations should also depend on the amount of already existing humoral response reflected by AbL.[1]Antibody titers and protection against a SARS-CoV-2 infection, C.

In particular, it plays a crucial role in authorizing Covid-19 vaccines. It has been reported that Covid-19 vaccine efficacy varies with a number of factors, including demographics of population, time after vaccine administration, and virus strains. By examining clinical trial data of three Covid-19 vaccine studies, we find that current approach to evaluating vaccines with an overall efficacy does not provide desired accuracy. It requires no time frame during which a candidate vaccine is evaluated, and is subject to misuse, resulting in potential misleading information and interpretation. In particular, we illustrate with clinical trial data that the variability of vaccine efficacy is underestimated. We demonstrate that a new method may help to address these caveats. It leads to accurate estimation of the variation of efficacy, provides useful information to define a reasonable time frame to evaluate vaccines, and avoids misuse of vaccine efficacy and misleading information.', metadata={'title': 'Covid-19 Vaccine Efficacy: Accuracy Assessment, Comparison, and Caveats', 'venue': 'Journal of Data Science', 'year': 2023, 'paperId': '1371d45d5f533ac909e8efa6b1d9e7da7f071b6e', 'citationCount': 0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://jds-online.org/journal/JDS/article/1327/file/pdf', 'authors': ['Wenjiang J.

Previously, we demonstrated that the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)‐based COVID‐19 vaccine rVSV‐SARS‐CoV‐2, with poor immunogenicity via the intramuscular route (i.m.), is more suitable for i.n. administration in mice and nonhuman primates. Here, we found that the rVSV‐SARS‐CoV‐2 Beta variant was more immunogenic than the wild‐type strain and other variants of concern (VOCs) in golden Syrian hamsters. Furthermore, the immune responses elicited by rVSV‐based vaccine candidates via the i.n. route were significantly higher than those of two licensed vaccines: the inactivated vaccine KCONVAC delivered via the i.m. route and the adenovirus‐based Vaxzevria delivered i.n. or i.m. We next assessed the booster efficacy of rVSV following two i.m. doses of KCONVAC. Twenty‐eight days after receiving two i.m. doses of KCONVAC, hamsters were boosted with a third dose of KCONVAC (i.m.), Vaxzevria (i.m. or i.n.), or rVSVs (i.n.). Consistent with other heterologous booster studies, Vaxzevria and rVSV elicited significantly higher humoral immunity than the homogenous KCONVAC. In summary, our results confirmed that two i.n. doses of rVSV‐Beta elicited significantly higher humoral immune responses than commercial inactivated and adeno‐based COVID vaccines in hamsters. As a heterologous booster dose, rVSV‐Beta induced potent, persistent, and broad‐spectrum humoral and mucosal neutralizing responses against all VOCs, highlighting its potential to be developed into a nasal‐spray vaccine.', metadata={'title': 'Comparison of the immunogenicity of nasal‐spray rVSV vector, adenovirus vector, and inactivated COVID‐19‐based vaccines in rodent models', 'venue': 'Journal of Medical Virology', 'year': 2023, 'paperId': '35bba47d715f41cd351cb3bc0094d7ce5c8d0c94', 'citationCount': 0, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'authors': ['Yuhang Zhang', 'Jiandong Liu', 'Hongyue Li', 'Fei Yuan', 'Congli Jiang', 'Tianle Cang', 'Kelei Li', 'Qiang Hu', 'Jiankai Liu', 'Aihua Zheng'], 'externalIds': {'DOI': '10.1002/jmv.28806', 'CorpusId': 258842948, 'PubMed': '37219050'}}),\n",

Inactivated vaccines, attenuated vaccines, and influenza vaccines all aim to boost the body's immunity against bacteria. By comparison, it is found that the covid-19 vaccine is more effective than the influenza vaccine but requires 2-3 injections and booster injections to consolidate. In addition, this article also considers the development of vaccines in the future. If the future vaccines have multiple effects in one shot, it will reduce the risk of future spread of the epidemic and the pressure on hospitals. In conclusion, the epidemic has brought many troubles to our lives. Vaccines, as the result of scientific and technological development, can eliminate most of the threats, but the virus will also mutate the corresponding vaccines. Therefore, for future consideration, developing a more efficient vaccine with fewer side effects to fight the virus is a guarantee for human safety.\", metadata={'title': 'Mechanism and efficiency of COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine', 'venue': 'International Conference on Biomedical and Intelligent Systems', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '729aa48451f6158fe7d4b8e7a294795ca24221ee', 'citationCount': 0, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'authors': ['Zhirui Li'], 'externalIds': {'DOI': '10.1117/12.2660420', 'CorpusId': 254395448}}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Safety Surveillance of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Through the Vaccine Safety Datalink.;\\n ABSTRACT:Vaccines represent one of the greatest public health achievements of modern medicine. They must pass rigorous and predetermined efficacy and safety metrics prior to licensure. Additionally, postmarketing safety surveillance is essential to detect rare or severe vaccine-associated adverse events, particularly because of the large numbers of individuals exposed. A primary method for postmarketing vaccine safety surveillance is voluntary reporting through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, voluntary reporting has limitations, such as case underreporting. The sensitivity of VAERS for capturing anaphylaxis ranged from 13% to 76% and Guillain-Barré syndrome from 12% to 64% for different vaccines.1 Additional concerns with VAERS data include challenges with determination of causality between the vaccine and the reported event and the lack of a comparison group to assess excess vs baseline risk in a given population. A 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine found inadequate evidence to accept or reject a causal relationship for 85% of vaccine–adverse event pairings studied.2 To address these issues, the CDC Immunization Safety Office created the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project to conduct postmarketing evaluations of vaccine safety within a defined population. A primar y analytic approach for postmarketing surveillance by VSD is rapid cycle analysis (RCA), whereby the observed number of adverse events is compared with the expected number of events, with the expected number of events determined from prior data, a concurrent comparison control group, or self-control methods. Weekly VSD comparisons assess many safety outcomes of interest; as such, the threshold for statistical significance is adjusted to account for multiple outcomes and multiple data assessments. Studies by VSD using RCA were conducted previously for rotavirus, acellular diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, and meningococcal conjugate vaccines.3,4 In this issue of JAMA, Klein et al5 apply RCA to assess the safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273 by Moderna) from December 2020 through June 2021. The exposure of interest was receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, from 1 to 21 days after dose 1 or dose 2, of vaccine-eligible members of 8 US health plans that participated in the VSD. The expected number of events was determined by a concurrent comparison control group, primarily members who were vaccinated 22 to 42 days after their recent dose, but a secondary comparison control group also included unvaccinated members. Comparators were in the same age, sex, race and ethnicity, and site stratum as the vaccinated cases. Twenty-three serious outcomes were considered, selected based on data from the phase 3 clinical trial results for the mRNA vaccines (eg, Bell palsy, appendicitis), COVID-19 disease concerns (eg, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome), and other historical vaccine safety concerns (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome, anaphylaxis). Each outcome was identified through diagnostic code algorithms that were supported based on prior studies, expert opinion, or both. Cases of Guillain-Barré, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and myocarditis/pericarditis required confirmation by health record review for inclusion. There was a predetermined significance threshold of a 1-sided P value <0.0048 to keep type I error below .05 considering weekly analyses over the planned 2-year surveillance period. For 4 other outcomes without appropriate comparators (anaphylaxis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and narcolepsy), descriptive analyses were performed considering cases within 84 days postvaccination. Potential anaphylaxis cases were considered on vaccination days 0 and 1 only and required medical record review to exclude other allergens and apply the Brighton Collaboration criteria with level 1, 2, or 3 considered confirmed anaphylaxis. Across almost 12 million mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses (57% Pfizer-BioNTech, 43% Moderna) administered to 6.2 million individuals aged 12 years or older (54% female; mean age, 49 years; 15% Asian, 5% Black non-Hispanic, 22% Hispanic/Latino, and 43% White non-Hispanic), no outcomes met the prespecified signaling criteria for statistical significance. Rate ratios (RRs) were largest for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (2.60), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (1.55), and transverse myelitis (1.45), but these measures of association had wide 95% CIs and nonsignificant P values. The RR for venous thromboembolism in the risk interval vs comparison interval was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.34); however, the 2-sided P value of .05 was not significant in this study given the predetermined threshold. The highest estimates of excess cases per million doses were 7.5 (95% CI, −0.1 to 14.0) for venous thromboembolism, 1.2 (95% CI, −6.9 to 8.3) for acute myocardial infarction, and 1.2 (95% CI, −2.1 to 3.3) for myocarditis/pericarditis. Venous thromboembolism was linked with viral vector COVID-19 vaccines, but a link to mRNA vaccines is limited to case reports.6,7 While mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of myocarditis/pericarditis overall, mRNA Related article page 1390 Opinion', metadata={'title': 'Safety Surveillance of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Through the Vaccine Safety Datalink.', 'venue': 'Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': 'bbeaab793a1ed87ae47ea304eb31aba15444d669', 'citationCount': 10, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/articlepdf/2784017/jama_blumenthal_2021_ed_210065_1633976049.6244.pdf', 'authors': ['K.

In the attempt to control the spread of the disease and the pandemic, numerous COVID-19 vaccines are in development. A review of the evidence on their efficacy and safety are critical. \\nMethods. A search for trials was done using the COVID-19 Living OVerview of Evidence (L·OVE) platform. We also searched for relevant authorization documents and trial reports for COVID-19 vaccines of the US-Food and Drug Authority (US-FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United Kingdom Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the WHO website. We included studies that fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: population – humans; intervention – COVID-19 vaccines; comparison – control or placebo; outcomes – efficacy and adverse events; methods – phase 3 randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened the reports, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data on the trial characteristics and results on vaccine efficacy and safety. The date of last search was March 11, 2021. \\nResults. Interim results of trials investigating five vaccines were identified and included in the review. All five vaccines demonstrated satisfactory vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adults in the short term with moderate certainty of evidence: BNT162b2, VE 95% (95% CI 90.3, 97.6); mRNA-1273, VE 93.6% (95% CI 88.6, 96.5); ChAdOx1, VE 66.7% (95% CI 57.4, 74.0), Gam-COVID-Vac, VE 91.1% (95% CI 83.6, 95.1); and Ad26.CoV2.S, VE 67.2% (95% CI 59.3, 73.7). Data on the efficacy against severe COVID-19 infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive, except for Ad26.CoV2.S, which demonstrated good efficacy in preventing moderate and/or severe COVID-19 infection and acceptable protection against asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 28 days after vaccination (moderate certainty of evidence). Efficacy data on preventing death from COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive. Very limited phase 3 trial data is available to inform vaccine efficacy against the different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination with these five vaccines was associated with higher adverse reactions compared to control. These adverse events, due to reactions to the vaccines, were mild to moderate and of short duration. Available evidence on vaccine efficacy and safety is limited, mainly due to the short follow up and the small sample size of specific populations. \\nConclusion. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, Gam-COVID-Vac and Ad26.CoV.S vaccines demonstrated satisfactory vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adults in the short term with moderate certainty of evidence. Data on the efficacy against severe COVID-19 infection, asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, and death from COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive.

Methods: A prospective, comparative cohort study was conducted in Beijing Ditan Hospital to evaluate the clinical, immunological and genomic characteristics of COVID-19 breakthrough infections. Data on 88 COVID-19 breakthrough cases (vaccinated group) and 41 unvaccinated cases (unvaccinated group) from June 1 to August 20, 2021 were extracted from a cloud database. Among these 129 COVID-19 cases, we successfully sequenced 33 whole genomes, including 16 from the vaccinated group and 17 from the unvaccinated group. Results: Asymptomatic and mild cases predominated in both groups, but 2 patients developed severe disease in the unvaccinated group. Between the two groups, the median time of viral shedding in the vaccinated group were significantly lower than those in the unvaccinated group (p = 0.003). A comparison of dynamic IgG titres of cases in the two groups indicated that IgG titres in the vaccinated group showed a significantly increasing trend (P =0.028). The CD4+T lymphocyte count was lower in the unvaccinated group, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.018). In the vaccinated group, the number of moderate cases who received Sinopharm BBIBP (42 cases) was significantly higher than those who received Sinovac Coronavac (p=0.020). Whole-genome sequencing revealed 23 cases of delta variants, including 15 patients from the vaccinated group. However, no significant difference was observed in either the RT-qPCR results or viral shedding time. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections were mainly asymptomatic and mild, the IgG titres were significantly higher and increased rapidly, and the viral shedding was short. Delta variants may be more likely to cause breakthrough infections, and vaccination may not reduce the viral loads and shedding time.', metadata={'title': 'Comprehensive genomic, immunological and clinical analysis of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections: a prospective, comparative cohort study', 'venue': 'medRxiv', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '3248a6d8e5417bea01a994d8ec9b487e5bae9c0e', 'citationCount': 0, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/11/21/2021.11.17.21266499.full.pdf', 'authors': ['D.

In this context, the timely clinical trial for the simian adenovirus-based ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against the South African B.1.351 variant [1] is worth a deeper analysis and comparison to other COVID-19 vaccines evaluated for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled, phase II clinical trial, conducted in South Africa in 2026 HIV-negative adults from the age group 18-65 years, received either two doses of 5 x 1010 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 particles or placebo 21 to 35 days apart. The conclusions of the study are rather disappointing indicating that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 caused by the B.1.351 variant. Initially, 3022 individuals were screened resulting in 1010 participants receiving the vaccine and 1011 individuals were subjected to placebo. The median age of the patients was 30 years and 56.5% were male. According to the publication, 70.5% were Black Africans, 12.8% White, 14.9% of mixed race and the rest 1.8% of other races. Among the participants, 19% were obese, 42% smokers, 2.8% had underlying hypertension and 3.1% had chronic respiratory conditions. Evaluation of administration safety demonstrated that local and systemic reactogenicity was similar among individuals receiving vaccine and placebo. Only a single serious adverse event was registered for the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine after the first dose, where the vaccinee developed a fever response of 40°C, which subsided within 24 hours. No reactogenicity was detected after the second dose. Strong humoral immune responses were observed after the first immunization with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a further enhancement seen after the second vaccination. Moreover, the neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 variant was evaluated with pseudovirus and live-virus assays [2,3] in 25 individuals, who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at enrolment but showed neutralizing antibody activity against SARS-CoV-2 D614G 14 days after the second vaccination. Six of the 25 individuals belonged to the placebo group and had most likely been infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain prior to the spread of the B.1.351 variant in South Africa. Moreover, PCR testing demonstrated that 6 vaccine recipients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 14 days after the second vaccination.

Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among subjects with either solid or hematological cancers who had received two doses of either mRNA or non-mRNA vaccines within 6 months. The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG and NAb were analyzed using the Mindray Immunoassay Analyzer CL-900i. Statistical analysis was conducted using mean comparison and regression analysis. Result The mRNA-1273 vaccine had the highest median levels of S-RBD IgG and NAb, followed by BNT162b, ChAdOx1nCoV-19, and BBIBP-CorV/Coronavac. The levels of S-RBD IgG and NAb in subjects vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were significantly higher than those of non-mRNA vaccines when grouped based on their characteristics, including age, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and comorbidity (p<0.05). Furthermore, the S-RBD IgG and NAb levels between the subjects vaccinated with non-mRNA vaccines and the subjects vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were significantly different (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the same types of vaccines. This study demonstrated a very strong correlation between the level of S-RBD IgG and the level of NAb (R = 0.962; p<0.001). The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG was consistently higher compared to the level of NAb.

       " Document(page_content='COVID-19 vaccination behavior and outcomes in patients with genitourinary cancer in comparison with other cancer types.;\\n ABSTRACT:134 Background: Cancer(ca) and old age are risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 (C19+) disease, related morbidity and mortality. These patients (pts) were excluded from clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of 3 FDA approved C19 vaccines (vax). Genitourinary (GU) ca-prostate, bladder and kidney ca contribute to the majority of non-skin ca and median age of these pts range from 65-75 yrs. We aimed to study these highly vulnerable pts behavior and outcomes regarding C19 vax in comparison to non-GU ca pts (18-89 years). Methods: A prospective and observational single center study. Adult ca pts seen in clinics from Nov 2021-Sept 2022 were randomly interviewed using telephone surveys after a verbal consent. Type of ca and therapy data were collected from pts’ medical records. The survey included C19 disease status, vax status positive (+) or negative (-), reason for vax status, side effects (s.e), impact on ca Rx or ca progression. Data was entered on REDCap. The primary end point was rate of vaccination in adult ca pts. Secondary end points were to quantify C19 vax acceptance vs. hesitance, identify s.e of C19 vax and effect of C19 vax on outcomes in GU and non-GU Ca pts. Results: N=172; GU ca 21 (12.2%) and non-GU ca 151 (87.8%). Among GU ca pts- 9 had prostate ca, 7 had bladder ca and 5 had renal ca. C19+ in 4 (19%) GU and 45 (30.2%) non-GU pts. GU pts: 90.5% received C19 vax (Pfizer 47.6%; Moderna 42.9%, J & J 0%); 9.5% were not vaxed. Non-GU pts: 85.2% received C19 vax (Pfizer 39.1%; Moderna 43%, J & J 2.6%); 14.8% were not vaxed. The top 3 risk factors for serious C19+ were age >65yr (76.2%), heart disease (61.9%) and BMI>30 (42.9%) in GU ca pts and age >65yr (46.4%), BMI>30 (35.1%) and smoking (19.9%) in non-GU ca pts. The top 3 reasons for C19 vax (+) in GU ca pts: protection against C19+ for self (81%), for others (47.6%) and provider recommendation (38.1%). The main reasons for vax hesitancy in C19 vax (-) GU ca pts: concern for allergy to the vax (4.8%) and prior C19 infection (4.8%). The common s.e of C19 vax reported in GU ca pts were injection site inflammation (19%), headache (4.8%), muscle/body aches (4.8%) but no lymphadenopathy. None of GU ca pts reported delay in Rx or progression of the disease due to C-19 vax. Conclusions: C19 vax were overall well tolerated and did not impact ca outcomes in pts with GU malignancies. Oncologists should discuss the importance of C19 vax in the context of ca. Clinical trial information: NCT04953065 .

Animal models, and in particular non-human primates, are essential to understand the pathogenesis of emerging diseases and to the safety and efficacy of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract and causes pulmonary lesions in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, resembling the mild clinical cases of COVID-19 in humans. Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were also similar in both species and equivalent to those reported in milder infections and convalescent human patients. Importantly, we have devised a new method for lung histopathology scoring that will provide a metric to enable clearer decision making for this key endpoint. In contrast to prior publications, in which rhesus are accepted to be the optimal study species, we provide convincing evidence that both macaque species authentically represent mild to moderate forms of COVID-19 observed in the majority of the human population and both species should be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel and repurposed interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Accessing cynomolgus macaques will greatly alleviate the pressures on current rhesus stocks.', metadata={'title': 'Comparison of Rhesus and Cynomolgus macaques as an authentic model for COVID-19', 'venue': 'bioRxiv', 'year': 2020, 'paperId': 'f7e9418d6e7b9d6ec3dd084cfbbae63d3912410c', 'citationCount': 7, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/17/2020.09.17.301093.full.pdf', 'authors': ['F.

       " Document(page_content='Hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin have similar effects in early COVID-19: a\\xa0head-to-head\\xa0comparison of the Pre-AndroCoV Trial.;\\n ABSTRACT:\\n Background: COVID-19 pandemic requires urgent responses in terms of identification of effective and safe therapies to reduce hospitalization, death, and post-COVID symptoms, while vaccines are not extensively available. Repurposing already existing medications for COVID-19 should be preferred over the development of new drugs due to their inherent advantages of well-established safety profile, familiarity, and cost. Although antiandrogens have strong plausibility to be effective against COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin gained unquestionable popularity due to their in vitro and in vivo direct or indirect antiviral activity, and preliminary observations of efficacy against COVID-19. The objective of the present open-label prospective observational study (the pre-AndroCoV trial) was to make a head-to-head comparative analysis between hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin, in terms of potential efficacy for COVID-19, combined with early COVID-19 detection, aiming to choose one of these three drugs to include in the AndroCoV randomized clinical trial (RCT).Materials and methods: Participants were recruited from social media and referred from other medical centers. Patients confirmed for COVID-19 with positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 with fewer than seven days of symptoms and four days of treatment were included. Patients were actively questioned for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), presence of approximately 40 existing diseases and regular use of 30 drug classes, and COVID-19 symptomatology. Hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice daily for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day for three consecutive days was given in a quasi-random manner, in association with azithromycin 500mg/day for five days, and optional addition of vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc, and glucocorticoids and anticoagulants in case of signs of lung injury or higher risk for thrombosis, respectively. Patients were followed up for 60 days, including active questions on disease course and symptoms on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 30, and virtual medical visits on Days 0 and 14, and whenever symptoms got worse on in the presence of severe adverse effects. Results: In total, 585 participants, including 270 females and 305 males, were included. Of these, 159, 357, and 110 patients received hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, and ivermectin, respectively, with similar baseline characteristics and time-to-treat between them. The three groups had similar duration of positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, clinical disease duration and recovery speed. Of the 585 patients, none was hospitalized, needed mechanical ventilation, or died, and 1.5% persisted with symptoms after recovery.Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin seem to be similarly effective for overall clinical outcomes in COVID-19 when used before seven days of symptoms, and overwhelmingly superior compared to untreated COVID-19 population, even for those outcomes not influenced by placebo effect, at least when combined with azithromycin, and vitamin C, D and zinc in the majority of the cases. Between these drugs, nitazoxanide demonstrated the strongest broad spectrum antiviral activity, plausibility to act as an anti-COVID agent, and safety profile, at least at the time of the choice of the drug for the AndroCoV Trial.', metadata={'title': 'Hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin have similar effects in early COVID-19: a\\xa0head-to-head\\xa0comparison of the Pre-AndroCoV Trial.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2020, 'paperId': '81520971540ba4a938d03985d5c25122713eaa9e', 'citationCount': 8, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-98106/latest.pdf', 'authors': ['F.

       " Document(page_content='Potential factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy: A systematic review;\\n ABSTRACT:Background and aims Although vaccines are considered the most effective and fundamental therapeutic tools for consistently preventing the COVID-19 disease, worldwide vaccine hesitancy has become a widespread public health issue for successful immunization. The aim of this review was to identify an up-to-date and concise assessment of potential factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and refusal intention, and to outline the key message in order to organize these factors according to country count. Methods A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature articles indexed in reputable databases, mainly Pub Med (MEDLINE), Elsevier, Science Direct, and Scopus, was performed between21stJune 2021 and10th July 2021. After obtaining the results via careful screening using a PRISMA flow diagram, 47 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria and formed the basic structure of the review. Results In total, 11 potential factors were identified, of which the greatest number of articles (n = 28) reported “safety” (34.46%; 95% CI 25.05─43.87) as the overarching consideration, while “side effects” (38.73%; 95% CI 28.14─49.32) was reported by 22 articles, which was the next common factor. Other potential factors such as “effectiveness” were identified in 19 articles (29.98%; 95% CI 17.09─41.67), followed by “trust” (n = 15 studies; 27.91%; 95% CI 17.1─38.73),“information sufficiency”(n = 12; 34.46%; 95% CI 35.87─63.07),“efficacy”(n = 8; 28.73%; 95% CI 9.72─47.74), “conspiracy beliefs” (n = 8; 14.30%; 95% CI 7.97─20.63),“social influence” (n = 6; 42.11%; 95% CI 14.01─70.21), “political roles” (n = 4; 16.75%; 95% CI 5.34─28.16), “vaccine mandated” (n = 4; 51.20%; 95% CI 20.25─82.15), and “fear and anxiety” (n = 3; 8.73%; 95% CI 0.59─18.05). The findings for country-specific influential vaccination factors revealed that, “safety” was recognized mostly (n = 14) in Asian continents (32.45%; 95% CI 19.60─45.31), followed by the United States (n = 6; 33.33%; 95% CI12.68─53.98). “Side effects” was identified from studies in Asia and Europe (n = 6; 35.78%; 95% CI 16.79─54.77 and 16.93%; 95% CI 4.70─28.08, respectively), followed by Africa (n = 4; 74.60%, 95% CI 58.08─91.11); however, public response to “effectiveness” was found in the greatest (n = 7) number of studies in Asian countries (44.84%; 95% CI 25─64.68), followed by the United States (n = 6; 16.68%, 95% CI 8.47─24.89). In Europe, “trust” (n = 5) appeared as a critical predictor (24.94%; 95% CI 2.32─47.56). “Information sufficiency” was identified mostly (n = 4) in articles from the United States (51.53%; 95% CI = 14.12─88.74), followed by Asia (n = 3; 40%; 95% CI 27.01─52.99). More concerns was observed relating to “efficacy” and “conspiracy beliefs” in Asian countries (n = 3; 27.03%; 95% CI 10.35─43.71 and 18.55%; 95% CI 8.67─28.43, respectively). The impact of “social influence” on making a rapid vaccination decision was high in Europe (n = 3; 23.85%, 95% CI -18.48─66.18), followed by the United States (n = 2; 74.85%). Finally, “political roles” and “vaccine-mandated” were important concerns in the United States. Conclusions The prevailing factors responsible for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy varied globally; however, the global COVID-19 vaccine acceptance relies on several common factors related to psychological and, societal aspect, and the vaccine itself.

This study was conducted to assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents (1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20.

       " Document(page_content='Attitudes of Poles towards the COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose: An Online Survey in Poland;\\n ABSTRACT:Introduction: COVID-19 vaccination has now become the most effective way to combat the pandemic, but there is a gradual decline in the protection that it offers over time. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA now recommend the use of the so-called booster dose, especially in at-risk groups. The purpose of the study was to assess the attitudes of Poles towards the recommendation to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and to evaluate the main reasons for refusing or delaying the decision. Material and methods: The study was based on a proprietary questionnaire distributed via the Internet. There were 1598 respondents, 54 of which did not consent to participate in the survey and/or did not complete the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. As a result, 1528 surveys were included in the final analysis. The vast majority of the respondents, namely 1275 (83.4%), were female, and 772 (50.5%) were residents of cities with a population of over 250,000. Results: Out of all respondents, 38 (2.5%) had already received the COVID-19 vaccine booster dose and 1031 (67.4%) would like to receive it as soon as possible. Forty-five (2.9%) respondents reported that they were completely unwilling to take the booster dose. The occurrence of adverse events after primary vaccination were reported by 79.9% of the survey participants. The most common reasons why the respondents refused to be vaccinated are lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the booster dose and the occurrence of adverse events in them or their loved ones. Age, gender, residence, or relationship status were not shown to affect attitudes towards the expansion of the basic vaccination schedule. Conclusions: One in three respondents plans to delay or refrain from taking the COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. The main reason for refusal to be vaccinated is the belief that the previous vaccination provides sufficient protection.', metadata={'title': 'Attitudes of Poles towards the COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose: An Online Survey in Poland', 'venue': 'Vaccines', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': 'cfa6f18a14a4946fca4fe9918e1ede834f26931d', 'citationCount': 20, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/1/68/pdf?version=1641116586', 'authors': ['M.

Here we aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate, WIBP-CorV, in participants aged 3-17 years. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial was conducted in Henan Province, China, in healthy children aged 3-17 years. 240 participants in phase 1 trial and 576 participants in phase 2 trial were randomly assigned to vaccine or control with an age de-escalation in three cohorts (3-5, 6-12 and 13-17 years) and dose-escalation in three groups (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0μg/dose), and received 3 intramuscular injections at day 0, 28, and 56. WIBP-CorV showed a promising safety profile with approximately 17% adverse reactions within 30 days after injection and no grade 3 or worse adverse events. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibody ranged from 102.2 to 1065.5 in vaccinated participants at 28 days after the third vaccination, and maintained at a range of 14.3 to 218.2 at day 180 after the third vaccination. WIBP-CorV elicited significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibody in the cohort aged 3-5 years than the other two cohorts. There were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups. Taken together, our data demonstrate that WIBP-CorV is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in participants aged 3-17 years, and elicited robust humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 lasted for at least 6 months after the third vaccination.

       " Document(page_content=\"Interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a scoping review.;\\n ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND\\nVaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID-19, a disease for which few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death. Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated.\\xa0In addition, new and vaccine-resistant mutations of SARS-CoV-2 may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID-19 is limited. Different vaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries and poses a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review maps interventions aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.\\xa0 OBJECTIVES: To scope the existing research landscape on interventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID-19, increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressed populations and intervention categories. \\xa0 SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to\\xa011 October 2021.\\xa0 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID-19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs), observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants. Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We did not limit the scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomes assessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines for diseases other than COVID-19.\\n\\n\\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\\nData were analysed according to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used an interactive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mapped the identified interventions according to pre-specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were: communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions, incentives (both financial and non-financial), interventions to improve access, and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, the addressed population, and whether the design was randomised-controlled or not.\\xa0 MAIN RESULTS: We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevant systematic reviews. For an overview, please see thehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=share https://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=share. \\xa0 Studies with published results Of the 61 studies with published results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventions investigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testing communication strategies to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Most studies assessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studies were conducted in English-speaking high-income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that were addressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at-risk patients, or the general population.\\xa0 Ongoing studies Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs and six NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used types of interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptake as an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted in English-speaking high-income countries. In contrast to the studies with published results, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populations range from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students. Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022. \\xa0 AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneous interventions for increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccine hesitancy.\\xa0Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives a comprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake and can be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake.\\xa0 A research gap was shown for studies conducted in low and middle-income countries and studies investigating policy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressing children and adolescents. As COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research.\", metadata={'title': 'Interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a scoping review.', 'venue': 'Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '831a1b497f04dbcf89a77e6cf50ef96dbd9f7ca4', 'citationCount': 8, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'authors': ['M.

       " Document(page_content='COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: A Case Study from Nepal;\\n ABSTRACT:While vaccine acceptance changes over time, and factors determining vaccine acceptance differ depending on disease and region, limited studies have evaluated vaccine acceptance in Nepal. We conducted an online, cross-sectional study to assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among Nepalese. Data were collected before and after the vaccine approval in Nepal, during which 576 and 241 responses were obtained, respectively. We found that vaccine acceptance was generally high among Nepalese (93%) and increased after the safety of vaccine was examined by the regulatory bodies (98%). This indicated the role of the national drug regulatory authority to convey drug safety. In addition, we analyzed the predictor(s) of vaccine acceptance. We found that the people who believe that vaccine is an effective measure in preventing and controlling the disease were highly likely to accept vaccination. Given that Nepal had just passed the most devastating wave of COVID-19 during our post-approval data collection, we assume that this might have also played a role in the belief that vaccination is an appropriate approach to combat the pandemic. Likewise, the number of people willing to vaccinate as soon as possible increased from 43% to 86% after approval. Therefore, our results indicate that the government needs to focus on assuring the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine to enhance acceptance. Although fewer responses obtained after vaccine approval might have affected our results, overall, our findings indicate vaccine acceptance is likely to be affected by socio-demographic factors and the attitudes of respondents. This should be carefully considered in the rollout of the vaccination plans in Nepal and countries alike in future.', metadata={'title': 'COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: A Case Study from Nepal', 'venue': 'COVID', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': 'c231a2e41e698133bf0d39f19e08559642ff2be4', 'citationCount': 4, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8112/2/8/75/pdf?version=1658739660', 'authors': ['A.

This study uses qualitative coding methodology to identify salient narratives and rhetorical styles common to anti-vaccine and COVID-denialist media. It organizes these narratives and rhetorics according to theme, imagined antagonist, and frequency.

Since the 1960s, tests of vaccine candidates for diseases such as dengue, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown a paradoxical phenomenon: Some animals or people who received the vaccine and were later exposed to the virus developed more severe disease than those who had not been vaccinated (1).

Hesitancy regarding vaccines persists among adults in the United States, despite overwhelming scientific evidence of safety and efficacy. Objective The purpose of this study was to use the Health Belief Model (HBM) and reasoned action approach (RAA) to examine COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy by comparing those who had already received 1 vaccine to those who had received none. Methods This study examined demographic and theory-based factors associated with vaccine uptake and intention among 1643 adults in the United States who completed an online survey during February and March 2021. Survey items included demographic variables (eg, age, sex, political ideology), attitudes, and health belief variables (eg, perceived self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility). Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used for vaccine uptake/intent. The first model included demographic variables. The second model added theory-based factors to examine the association of health beliefs and vaccine uptake above and beyond the associations explained by demographic characteristics alone. Results The majority of participants were male (n=974, 59.3%), White (n=1347, 82.0%), and non-Hispanic (n=1518, 92.4%) and reported they had already received a COVID-19 vaccine or definitely would when it was available to them (n=1306, 79.5%). Demographic variables significantly associated with vaccine uptake/intent included age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06), other race (AOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.83 vs White), and political ideology (AOR 15.77, 95% CI 7.03-35.35 very liberal vs very conservative). The theory-based factors most strongly associated with uptake/intention were attitudes (AOR 3.72, 95% CI 2.42-5.73), self-efficacy (AOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.34-2.29), and concerns about side effects (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.76). Although race and political ideology were significant in the model of demographic characteristics, they were not significant when controlling for attitudes and beliefs. Conclusions Vaccination represents one of the best tools to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other possible pandemics in the future. This study showed that older age, attitudes, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy are positively associated with vaccine uptake and intent, whereas perceived side effects and lack of trust in the vaccine are associated with lower uptake and intent. Race and political ideology were not significant predictors when attitudes and beliefs were considered. Before vaccine hesitancy can be addressed, researchers and clinicians must understand the basis of vaccine hesitancy and which populations may show higher hesitancy to the vaccination so that interventions can be adequately targeted.', metadata={'title': 'Factors Associated With the Intention to Receive the COVID-19 Vaccine: Cross-sectional National Study', 'venue': 'JMIR Public Health and Surveillance', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '8bfb81ca57a388950cc438ffb8b4aeee557b4f79', 'citationCount': 4, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://publichealth.jmir.org/2022/11/e37203/PDF', 'authors': ['M.

Yet vaccine hesitancy remains a serious problem and can pose certain hazards to individuals' mental health, such as rising anxiety. Therefore, based on Self-Discrepancy Theory, this paper aims to explore the role of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy on individual generalized anxiety disorder and its influence mechanisms through two studies. Methods Study one involved 654 Chinese participants using the Vaccine Hesitancy Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. In Study two, the Vaccine Hesitation Questionnaire, GAD-7 scale, Perceived Risk of COVID-19 pandemic scale, and Vaccination Status Questionnaire were used and data from 3,282 Chinese residents was collected. Results Vaccine hesitancy directly increases generalized anxiety disorder; risk perception plays a partial mediating role between vaccine hesitancy and generalized anxiety disorder; vaccination status moderated vaccine hesitancy's effect on risk perception and generalized anxiety disorder. Conclusion Vaccine hesitancy predicts generalized anxiety disorder through risk perception, but the mediating role of risk perception is moderated by vaccination status, which means that for the vaccinated group when their vaccine hesitancy is reduced, it will be easier to reduce the risk perception and thus the generalized anxiety disorder.\", metadata={'title': 'COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and GAD: The role of risk perception and vaccination status', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Public Health', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '01fc1ba37c48d60672a6bcd8e9ea1cee9f769f1e', 'citationCount': 5, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.994330/pdf', 'authors': ['Bin Wang', 'Xiao-lin Zhong', 'Hao Fu', 'Mengting He', 'Ruilin Hu'], 'externalIds': {'PubMedCentral': '9627496', 'DOI': '10.3389/fpubh.2022.994330', 'CorpusId': 253023760, 'PubMed': '36339202'}}),\n",

This study assesses COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy and associated factors, beliefs and barriers associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 492 Bangladeshi residents (76% male; mean age = 24.21 ± 4.91 years; age range = 18–50 years) prior to the nationwide mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign (September 28, 2021). A semi-structured e-questionnaire included three sections (demographic variables, beliefs around the vaccination, and perceived barriers regarding COVID-19 vaccination). Results More than a quarter of participants (26.42%) were hesitant, 70.33% reported to accept the vaccine, and 3.25% refused to be vaccinated. While (54%) believed that mass vaccination would be the most effective method to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns regarding the side effects of the vaccine (58%), inadequate vaccine trials before human administration (43%), commercial profiteering (42%), and mistrust of the benefits of the vaccine (20%) were also reported. In addition, other barriers including a short supply of vaccines, unknown future adverse effects (55%), low confidence in the health system (51%), doubts regarding its effectiveness (50%) and safety (45%), and insufficient information regarding potential adverse effects (44.7%) were reported. In bivariate analysis, variables such as current political affiliation, previous vaccination history, and health status were significantly associated with the COVID-19 vaccine uptake variable (acceptance, hesitancy, refusal). Regression analysis showed that participants who identified with the opposing current political parties, and not having been vaccinated since the age of 18 years were significantly more likely to report vaccine hesitancy.

Vaccines are considered the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases, which has been reaffirmed for COVID-19. However, in the context of the continuing virus spread because of insufficient vaccination coverage and emergence of new variants of concern, there is a high demand for vaccination strategy amendment. The ability to elicit protective immunity at the entry gates of infection provided by mucosal vaccination is key to block virus infection and transmission. Therefore, these mucosal vaccines are believed to be a “silver bullet” that could bring the pandemic to an end. Here, we demonstrate that the intranasally delivered Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine induced a robust (no less than 180 days) systemic and local immune response in mice. High immunogenic properties of the vaccine were verified in non-human primates (common marmosets) by marked IgG and neutralizing antibody (NtAb) production in blood serum, antigen-specific Tcell proliferation and cytokine release of peripheral blood mononuclear cells accompanied by formation of IgA antibodies in the nasal mucosa. We also demonstrate that Sputnik V vaccine can provide sterilizing immunity in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice exposed to experimental lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection protecting them against severe lung immunopathology and mortality. We believe that intranasal Sputnik V vaccine is a promising novel needle-free mucosal vaccine candidate for primary immunization as well as for revaccination and is worth further clinical investigation.', metadata={'title': 'Immunogenicity and protectivity of intranasally delivered vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V in mice and non-human primates', 'venue': 'Emerging Microbes and Infections', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '7c24373f9f6c4d4d2aca8903f3c0884c0a6545b7', 'citationCount': 5, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'authors': ['A.

CoronaVac, which is an inactivated virus vaccine, was the first imported COVID‐19 vaccine in Thailand. To investigate the safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac within the Thai population, we conducted a prospective cohort study among health care workers aged 18–59 years, who received a 2‐dose regimen of CoronaVac 21 days apart between March and April 2021 at the hospital in Samut Sakhon, Thailand. We recruited 185 participants with a mean age of 32 years. Total antibodies against receptor‐binding domain (RBD) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 were tested. Total antibodies against RBD were negative before immunization. One volunteer was positive for N, although negative for the RBD antibodies. The seroconversion rate of total antibodies against RBD after the first CoronaVac dose was 67% with a Geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 1.98 U/ml. Following CoronaVac dose 2, the seroconversion rate increased to 100% with a GMC of 92.9 U/ml. The seroconversion rates of IgG against N protein were 1% after dose 1 and 62.8% after dose 2. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 59.5%. Injection‐site pain was the most common local adverse event (52.4%), while myalgia was the most common systemic adverse event (31.9%). No serious adverse events were observed. A 0–21 days, 2‐dose CoronaVac regimen appears safe, inducing a satisfactory response compared with convalescent serum obtained 4–6 weeks postnatural infection. Antibody responses after 2‐dose CoronaVac were comparable to the convalescent plasma but waned rapidly after 3 months.

       " Document(page_content='New Wave of COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions in the Month the 3rd Booster Dose Arrived;\\n ABSTRACT:Vaccination has been proposed as one of the most effective methods to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the day the first vaccine, with an efficiency of more than 90%, was announced, the entire vaccination process and its possible consequences in large populations have generated a series of discussions on social media. Whereas the opinions triggered by the administration of the initial COVID-19 vaccine doses have been discussed in depth in the scientific literature, the approval of the so-called 3rd booster dose has only been analyzed in country-specific studies, primarily using questionnaires. In this context, the present paper conducts a stance analysis using a transformer-based deep learning model on a dataset containing 3,841,594 tweets in English collected between 12 July 2021 and 11 August 2021 (the month in which the 3rd dose arrived) and compares the opinions (in favor, neutral and against) with the ones extracted at the beginning of the vaccination process. In terms of COVID-19 vaccination hesitance, an analysis based on hashtags, n-grams and latent Dirichlet allocation is performed that highlights the main reasons behind the reluctance to vaccinate. The proposed approach can be useful in the context of the campaigns related to COVID-19 vaccination as it provides insights related to the public opinion and can be useful in creating communication messages to support the vaccination campaign.', metadata={'title': 'New Wave of COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions in the Month the 3rd Booster Dose Arrived', 'venue': 'Vaccines', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': 'f840abb5a20f40290ba6a0f16c8f0ae9cdbbc502', 'citationCount': 3, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/6/881/pdf?version=1654004514', 'authors': ['Camelia Delcea', 'Liviu-Adrian Cotfas', 'L.

Vaccine hesitancy and vaccine rates vary widely across countries and populations and are influenced by complex sociocultural, political, economic and psychological factors. Community engagement is an integral strategy within immunisation campaigns and has been shown to improve vaccine acceptance. As evidence on community engagement to support COVID-19 vaccine uptake is emerging and constantly changing, research that lessens the knowledge-to-practice gap by providing regular and up-to-date evidence on current best-practice is essential. Methods and analysis A living systematic review will be conducted which includes an initial systematic review and bimonthly review updates. Searching and screening for the review and subsequent updates will be done in four streams: a systematic search of six databases, grey literature review, preprint review and citizen sourcing. The screening will be done by a minimum of two reviewers at title/abstract and full-text in Covidence, a systematic review management software. Data will be extracted across predefined fields in an excel spreadsheet that includes information about article characteristics, context and population, community engagement approaches, and outcomes. Synthesis will occur using the convergent integrated approach. We will explore the potential to quantitatively synthesise primary outcomes depending on heterogeneity of the studies. Ethics and dissemination The initial review and subsequent bimonthly searches and their results will be disseminated transparently via open-access methods. Quarterly briefs will be shared on the reviews’ social media platforms and across other interested networks and repositories. A dedicated web link will be created on the Community Health-Community of Practice site for sharing findings and obtaining feedback. A mailing list will be developed and interested parties can subscribe for updates.

We collected a large sample of COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation and corrective messages on Facebook as well as the users’ emotional reactions (i.e., emojis) to these messages. Focusing on three clusters of features such as messages’ linguistic features, source characteristics, and messages’ network positions, we examined whether users’ reactions to misinformation and corrective information would differ. We used random forest models to identify the most salient predictors among over 70 predictors for both types of messages. Our analysis found that for misinformation, political ideology of the message source was the most salient feature that predicted anxious and enthusiastic reactions, followed by message features that highlight personal concerns and messages’ network positions. For corrective messages, while the sources’ ideology was still key to raising anxiety, the most important feature for triggering enthusiasm was the messages’ network positions and message quality.', metadata={'title': 'Who Says What in Which Networks: What influences Social Media Users’ Emotional Reactions to the COVID-19 Vaccine Infodemic?', 'venue': 'Social science computer review', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '8eea91ace846a646c541708907e0e928840bdb45', 'citationCount': 3, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'authors': ['A.

However, far less is known about which Americans are most likely to refuse the vaccine and their reasons for reluctance. Understanding these issues is critical to developing effective health communications to improve COVID-19 vaccination and end the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod: We rely on a demographically representative survey of 5,009 American adults collected from May 28-June 8, 2020. We analyze the influence of demographic factors, political ideology, and COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. \\r\\n\\r\\nResults: 31.1% of Americans do not intend to pursue getting vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. The likelihood of refusal is higher for Blacks, women, and conservatives. People who are more concerned about COVID-19 were less likely to refuse the vaccine. Positive views of vaccination in general (vaccines are safe, effective, and important) were also negatively associated with vaccine refusal intention. The two most cited reasons for refusal are concerns about vaccine safety, and effectiveness. Reasons for reluctance vary across sub-populations. Women were most likely to be hesitant based on concerns about safety and efficacy. Blacks were more likely to be hesitant than Whites because of concerns about safety and efficacy, because they lack needed financial resources or health insurance, and because already had COVID-19.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: Large proportions of the American public do not intend to pursue a vaccine against COVID-19 once it becomes available, reducing its potential impact.

Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be the most effective intervention to prevent the spread of COVID-19. ZF2001 is a recombinant protein vaccine based on SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) subunit which contains aluminum adjuvant. In order to advance our research on ZF2001 into clinical trial, we investigated the general toxicity and immunogenicity of ZF2001 in cynomolgus monkeys and assessed the possible target organs for vaccine-induced toxicity. In the present research, we observed no significant systemic toxicities and abnormal cardiovascular and respiratory events following four times injections of intramuscular ZF2001 in cynomolgus monkeys. Histological examination revealed recoverable inflammatory changes in quadricep muscle and adjacent lymph node at the vaccine injection site. As expected, the vaccine can produce a strongly specific binding antibody and neutralizing antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys after inoculation. Taken together, our regulatory toxicology research proves the safety and immunogenicity of the ZF2001 vaccine, supporting its entry into large scale clinical trials.', metadata={'title': 'Preclinical Toxicity and Immunogenicity of a COVID-19 Vaccine (ZF2001) in Cynomolgus Monkeys', 'venue': 'Vaccines', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '62e8b879d7fa6fc947405529d883388544c80d37', 'citationCount': 2, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/12/2080/pdf?version=1670322943', 'authors': ['Hongzhong Yang', 'Wei-Gang Pan', 'Guoyu Chen', 'E.

However, little is known about their safety in patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA).\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe recruited 72 WDEIA patients and 730 healthy matched controls who received an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were monitored for 4 weeks after each immunization for adverse reactions and completed questionnaires regarding local and systemic reactions at 7 and 28 days after each vaccination. For those who had received the COVID-19 vaccine prior to enrollment, adverse event data were obtained retrospectively.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nLocal and systemic adverse events occurred at similar rates in the WDEIA group and the control group. In both groups, injection-site pain and fatigue were the most common local and systemic reactions, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, more allergic events were reported in the WDEIA group (after dose 1, 0.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.019; after dose 2, 0% vs. 1.4%, p=0.089). Allergic reactions mainly manifested as rash, urticaria, and edema, which were mild and controllable.

Vaccination, one of the most effective public health interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic, has become the focus of public online discussions. Several studies have demonstrated that social bots actively involved in topic discussions on social media and expressed their sentiments and emotions, which affected human users. However, it is unclear whether social bots’ sentiments affect human users’ sentiments of COVID-19 vaccines. This study seeks to scrutinize whether the sentiments of social bots affect human users’ sentiments of COVID-19 vaccines. The work identified social bots and built an innovative computational framework, i.e., the BERT-CNN sentiment analysis framework, to classify tweet sentiments at the three most discussed stages of COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter from December 2020 to August 2021, thus exploring the impacts of social bots on online vaccine sentiments of humans. Then, the Granger causality test was used to analyze whether there was a time-series causality between the sentiments of social bots and humans. The findings revealed that social bots can influence human sentiments about COVID-19 vaccines. Their ability to transmit the sentiments on social media, whether in the spread of positive or negative tweets, will have a corresponding impact on human sentiments.', metadata={'title': 'Could Social Bots’ Sentiment Engagement Shape Humans’ Sentiment on COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion on Twitter?', 'venue': 'Sustainability', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '54e56cdb837399658409f0a86584bf6945bdb155', 'citationCount': 2, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/9/5566/pdf?version=1651903793', 'authors': ['Menghan Zhang', 'Ze Chen', 'Xue Qi', 'Jun Liu'], 'externalIds': {'DOI': '10.3390/su14095566', 'CorpusId': 248591947}}),\n",

Having a better understanding of the public’s conceptions of COVID-19 vaccines may aid in the effort to promptly and thoroughly vaccinate the community. However, because no empirical research has yet fully explored the public’s vaccine awareness through sentiment–based topic modeling, little is known about the evolution of public attitude since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Objective In this study, we specifically focused on tweets about COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson) after vaccines became publicly available. We aimed to explore the overall sentiments and topics of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, as well as how such sentiments and main concerns evolved. Methods We collected 1,122,139 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from December 14, 2020, to April 30, 2021, using Twitter’s application programming interface. We removed retweets and duplicate tweets to avoid data redundancy, which resulted in 857,128 tweets. We then applied sentiment–based topic modeling by using the compound score to determine sentiment polarity and the coherence score to determine the optimal topic number for different sentiment polarity categories. Finally, we calculated the topic distribution to illustrate the topic evolution of main concerns. Results Overall, 398,661 (46.51%) were positive, 204,084 (23.81%) were negative, 245,976 (28.70%) were neutral, 6899 (0.80%) were highly positive, and 1508 (0.18%) were highly negative sentiments. The main topics of positive and highly positive tweets were planning for getting vaccination (251,979/405,560, 62.13%), getting vaccination (76,029/405,560, 18.75%), and vaccine information and knowledge (21,127/405,560, 5.21%). The main concerns in negative and highly negative tweets were vaccine hesitancy (115,206/205,592, 56.04%), extreme side effects of the vaccines (19,690/205,592, 9.58%), and vaccine supply and rollout (17,154/205,592, 8.34%). During the study period, negative sentiment trends were stable, while positive sentiments could be easily influenced. Topic heatmap visualization demonstrated how main concerns changed during the current widespread vaccination campaign. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate public COVID-19 vaccine awareness and awareness trends on social media with automated sentiment–based topic modeling after vaccine rollout. Our results can help policymakers and research communities track public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and help them make decisions to promote the vaccination campaign.', metadata={'title': 'COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets After Vaccine Rollout: Sentiment–Based Topic Modeling', 'venue': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': 'd15d35c1f637282583ca2f3ef43b98a9a7a1ad78', 'citationCount': 20, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.jmir.org/2022/2/e31726/PDF', 'authors': ['Luwen Huangfu', 'Yiwen Mo', 'Peijie Zhang', 'D.

Widespread vaccination is the most effective way to control the pandemic. Vaccination with the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is currently underway. We aimed to determine the attitude of adolescents toward the third dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A structured questionnaire was administered between 16 August and 28 October 2021 among adolescents aged 12–17 years in three provinces of eastern region of China based on convenience sampling. The questionnaire was specifically developed to assess the adolescents’ attitude toward and willingness to accept a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: In total, 94.3% (1742/1847) of the adolescents intended to accept the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Age between 15–17 years, no worry about vaccine safety, confidence for vaccine effectiveness, and supporting opinion from parents were independently associated with acceptance of the third dose (p < 0.05).

Consistent with ongoing efforts to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19, building a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19, which is recognized as a major achievement, is a priority for many developed countries around the world. In this regard, we aimed to investigate the determinants of public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: In this review, published articles on the determinants of public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine during 2020-2021 were reviewed. To obtain related scientific documents, the following keywords were searched in the title and abstract of published articles: Coronavirus 2019, COVID-19, and Vaccine acceptance, Resistance, Doubt, Vaccination, Determinants and Pandemics. Scientific databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and ProQuest were searched and all relevant English articles were listed. The PRISMA checklist was used to review and control the quality of articles. Results: Initially, 372 English articles were retrieved and finally 19 articles were finally selected for comprehensive review and data extraction. The results showed that most people were more receptive to vaccines that produce 90%-95% efficacy and safety levels. Also, being a woman, low age, low-income level, being single, low education and lack of trust in the government were among the factors that reduced the acceptance of people for the COVID-19 vaccine. The most common reasons for people not participating in the vaccination process were fear of vaccine side effects, lack of confidence in vaccine efficacy, and safety levels. Conclusion: Considering that a significant number of people in the world have a high acceptance of vaccines with 90%-95% safety levels. Measures need to be taken to speed up the vaccination process. Also, since most people are only afraid and anxious about the side effects caused by vaccines, it is necessary to increase people’s awareness and knowledge about the positive and negative consequences of vaccination.', metadata={'title': 'Determinants of Public Acceptance of the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Systematic Review', 'venue': 'International Clinical Neuroscience Journal', 'year': 2022, 'paperId': '85e4739b6ca3fbd1402524f45076380f9abe376f', 'citationCount': 1, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://journals.sbmu.ac.ir/neuroscience/article/download/35593/29212', 'authors': ['Farzin Bagheri', 'H.

       " Document(page_content='New Data on Heterologous COVID-19 Vaccine Combinations.;\\n ABSTRACT:Blocks Malaria in Early Trial An investigational monoclonal antibody called L9LS protected most recipients against malaria after controlled infection in a small phase 1 clinical trial, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. Currently, no antimalarial antibody is approved for clinical use. If successfully developed, adding antibodies to chemoprevention and vaccine therapies might substantially reduce malaria-related illness and deaths. The subcutaneous injection, taken once a season, could make antibodies cost-effective for treating high-risk groups including infants, young children, and pregnant women in regions where malaria is endemic, the report’s authors wrote. In the trial, healthy adult volunteers in the US were exposed to bites from infected mosquitoes and monitored for malaria parasites in their blood for 21 days. Of the 17 volunteers injected with L9LS before malaria infection, only 2 developed parasitemia, whereas all 6 untreated volunteers did. Of the L9LS-treated volunteers, 1 of 5 who received an intravenous dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight and 1 of 5 who received a dose of 5 mg per kilogram subcutaneously developed parasitemia. No participant who received an intravenous dose of 5 mg or 20 mg per kilogram developed parasitemia. No safety concerns emerged in the trial, which was funded and conducted by the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Deemed a next-generation monoclonal antibody, L9LS performed substantially better than previous antimalarial antibodies in preclinical studies and in the current clinical study. The antibody itself has a much higher affinity for its target protein, increasing its binding strength compared with earlier antibodies, while a gene modification helps it resist lysosomal breakdown, increasing its and serum half-life. L9LS works by interrupting the life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, the most common and deadly malaria parasite. The antibody latches onto a protein in the parasite’s sporozoite stage, which infects humans through mosquito saliva. This effectively halts the infection by keeping the sporozoites from attaching to liver cells, preventing production of the merozoites that then infect and massively multiply in red blood cells. L9LS also promotes the cytolytic destruction of sporozoites. “The current trial provides a proof of principle that prevention of malaria can be achieved with a next-generation monoclonal antibody, L9LS,” the authors wrote.

Social campaigns can emphasize the many arguments that potentially increase acceptance for vaccines: e.g., that they have been developed, tested, and recommended by doctors and scientists; and that they are safe, effective, and in demand. We verified the effectiveness of such messages in an online experiment conducted in February and March 2021 with a sample of almost six thousand adult Poles, which was nationally representative in terms of key demographic variables. We presented respondents with different sets of information about vaccinating against COVID-19. After reading the information bundle, they indicated whether they would be willing to be vaccinated. We also asked them to justify their answers and indicate who or what might change their opinion. Finally, we elicited a number of individual characteristics and opinions. We found that nearly 45% of the respondents were unwilling to be vaccinated, and none of the popular messages we used was effective in reducing this hesitancy. We also observed a number of significant correlates of vaccination attitudes, with men, older, wealthier, and non-religious individuals, those with higher education, and those trusting science rather than COVID-19 conspiracy theories being more willing to be vaccinated. We discuss important consequences for campaigns aimed at reducing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.', metadata={'title': 'Persuasive Messages Will Not Increase COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: Evidence from a Nationwide Online Experiment', 'venue': 'Vaccines', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '86c06cd22850c3f205cb556c057daaa797a34976', 'citationCount': 19, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/10/1113/pdf?version=1633682154', 'authors': ['Raman Kachurka', 'M.

Vaccination is the most effective way of controlling infectious diseases, while success is challenged by individuals and groups who choose to delay or refuse vaccines. The objective of the present study was to assess the intention of healthcare workers in Eastern Ethiopia to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional survey research design was used to collect quantitative data from a representative sample of healthcare workers in Dire Dawa, Haramaya, and Harar towns of Eastern Ethiopia. The correctly filled questionnaires were selected and entered into SPSS software for further analysis, where frequency tables, percentages, mean, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used in the process. Results The findings revealed that most (61.6%) of the research participants are willing to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine, and 10.3% reported that they have not decided yet. Moreover, the main reason for respondents’ lack of intention to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is the belief that the first round of COVID-19 vaccine is sufficient to prevent infection (27.8%) followed by concern over the safety or side effects of the vaccine (26.6%). Above all, the healthcare workers’ intention of taking the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is significantly associated to having children (OR=0.362, P<0.05; 95% CI: 3.279–5465.189), previous interaction with someone infected by COVID-19 (OR=1.480, P<0.05; 95% CI: 3.949–0.055), the perception that COVID-19 causes a severe illness (OR=0.018, P<0.05, 95% CI: 13.489–196.391), and experience of receiving the first round of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=50431.104, P<0.01; 95% CI: 408.789–626.00). Conclusion The present study has shown that healthcare workers in Eastern Ethiopia have a good intention of receiving the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Nevertheless, the findings have also made it clear that there are still issues to be addressed as far as both willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine and experience of taking the first round of the vaccine are concerned. It is, therefore, important that sufficient training should be given to the healthcare workers in the area in order to raise their level of awareness and enhance their willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine.', metadata={'title': 'Intention to Receive the Second Round of COVID-19 Vaccine Among Healthcare Workers in Eastern Ethiopia', 'venue': 'Infection and Drug Resistance', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '57507f15e62218de7fbc2d6512a944a1da6bd069', 'citationCount': 18, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=72514', 'authors': ['Bewunetu Zewude', 'Abreham Belachew'], 'externalIds': {'PubMedCentral': '8364848', 'DOI': '10.2147/IDR.S326055', 'CorpusId': 237193953, 'PubMed': '34408451'}}),\n",

For the high vaccine acceptance rate, it is important to determine the vaccine willingness of individuals and the barriers to vaccination. We aimed to determine the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine and the effect of attitudes, perception and beliefs on vaccination willingness among medical students. Methods: In February 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted online among medical student. A total of 734 medical students out of 980 medical students answered the questionnaire forms (response rate: 75.4%). The online questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, risk perception and beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy, rejection and acceptance were determined by self-report of medical students. Results: Total of 739 medical students included study. Students declared that 60.1% (n = 444) of them to be willing to vaccinated, 14.2% (n = 105) refused and 25.7% (n = 190) were not sure. Covid-19 willingness to be vaccinated was higher in female ( p = 0.005), clinical students ( p < 0.001), those who ever tested for COVID-19 ( p = 0.002), those who had covid-19 infection history in the family ( p = 0.043), those who had COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine education ( p = 0.001). Positive attitudes skor and higher knowledge scores were related with highly willingness to be vaccinated. High beliefs score (positive beliefs) was found to be associated with a higher willingness to be vaccinated ( p < 0.001). Conclusions: Although the majority of the study population willingness to be vaccinated, one-third of medical students are hesitant about vaccination.

Aim: The survey was conducted to assess the knowledge, perception and readiness of Nigerians to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted among the Nigerian populace from the 19th May to the 22nd of May, 2020. A 39-item survey instrument (questionnaire), which required about 7 minutes to complete, was developed using google forms via the Survey Monkey Platform, validated and the internet link distributed randomly to consenting participants from the six geopolitical zones of the country via the social media. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Software-Version 25 (SPSS-25) to measure frequencies and percentages of the variables. Bivariate analysis was also conducted using chi-square and bivariate logistic regression, and statistical significance was determined by p<0.05 to identify predictors of Nigerians’ readiness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Results: A total of 465 responses were gathered from adult respondents (aged 18 years and above; median age: 34.5 years) from the six geopolitical zones of the Country: South-west (48.4%), North-central (17.2%), South-south (16.3%), South-east (9.7%), North-west (4.5%) and North-east (3.9%). A higher proportions of the respondents were Christians by religion (84.5%) and were medical students (48.6%), followed by medical professionals (20.2%). Most of the participants used the social medial (80.2%) as their source of COVID-19 information. 96.0% of them had poor knowledge of the disease, while 39.0% had poor perception of the COVID-19 Vaccine trial. 22.6% were indifferent to the initiation of COVID-19 vaccine trial in Nigeria, 59.8% were in support, while 17.6% were not in support. A higher proportion of the respondents (80%) were unwilling to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial, while 20% were willing. Age, gender, educational level, religion, occupation, nature of monthly income and geopolitical zone had no significant impact (p>0.05) on the perception and readiness of the respondents to participate in the COVID-19 vaccines trial. However; religion significantly (p=0.0001, χ 2=20.797) influenced the knowledge of the disease among the respondents. Conclusion: Misinformation and disinformation strengthen vaccine skepticism and could undermine efforts to end the coronavirus pandemic.

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID‐19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID‐19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS‐CoV and to some extent on MERS‐CoV for designing and developing COVID‐19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID‐19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID‐19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past.', metadata={'title': 'Challenges and prospects of COVID‐19 vaccine development based on the progress made in SARS and MERS vaccine development', 'venue': 'Transboundary and Emerging Diseases', 'year': 2020, 'paperId': 'f6b49c990dcc2f71f3eae61c19d96274f1660f77', 'citationCount': 40, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.authorea.com/doi/pdf/10.22541/au.159008098.82988208', 'authors': ['Jubeda Begum', 'N.

This study assesses individual, disease-specific and contextual factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among a nationally representative sample of older Brazilian adults. Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from household interviews and a supplementary telephone survey. Setting Brazil and its five geographic regions. Participants Data are derived from 6584 individuals aged 50 years and over who participated in the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. Primary and secondary outcome measures Survey-weighted multinomial logistic regression assesses factors associated with intending, not intending or being uncertain about one’s intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Findings Seventy-one per cent of study participants intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once available, while 17% (representative of nearly 9 million people) have no intention to vaccinate, and 12% are still undecided. Besides age, demographic and health-related factors related to COVID-19 severity and complications were not associated with intention to vaccinate. Those who most trusted social media or friends and family for COVID-19 information and those who did not trust any information source were 68% and 78% more likely to refuse vaccination, respectively, as compared with those who trusted official information sources. People who inconsistently used face masks when outside were 3.4 times more likely than consistent face mask users to intend to refuse vaccination. Higher municipal COVID-19 fatality rates were negatively associated with vaccine refusal. Conclusions Most national COVID-19 immunisation strategies identify older individuals as among those prioritised for early vaccination, given their increased risk of more severe symptoms and complications of the disease. Because individual, disease-specific, and contextual factors were associated with vaccine acceptance, there is a clear need for multilevel and multichannel information and outreach campaigns to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among vulnerable older populations.', metadata={'title': 'Which older Brazilians will accept a COVID-19 vaccine?

A large volume of these data has led to the production of equally immense sets of immunological data, which require rigorous computational approaches to sort through and make sense of. Immunoinformatics has emerged in the recent decades as a field capable of offering this approach by bridging experimental and theoretical immunology with state-of-the-art computational tools. Here, we discuss how immunoinformatics can assist in the development of high-performance vaccines and drug discovery needed to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Immunoinformatics can provide a set of computational tools to extract meaningful connections from the large sets of COVID-19 patient data, which can be implemented in the design of effective vaccines. With this in mind, we represent a pipeline to identify the role of immunoinformatics in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development. In this process, a number of free databases of protein sequences, structures and mutations are introduced, along with docking web servers for assessing the interaction between antibodies and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein segments as most commonly considered antigens in vaccine design.', metadata={'title': 'Tracking the pipeline: immunoinformatics and the COVID-19 vaccine design.', 'venue': 'Briefings in Bioinformatics', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': 'c4b39b6f7c29c602af0a9028528d640634c196e3', 'citationCount': 11, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-pdf/22/6/bbab241/41087762/bbab241.pdf', 'authors': ['Shokouh Rezaei', 'Yahya Sefidbakht', 'V.

The world closely monitors research in this area, especially through media coverage, which plays a key role in the dissemination of trustful information and in the public’s understanding of science and health. On the other hand, anti-vaccine movements dispute space in this communication environment, which raises concerns of the authorities regarding the willingness of the population to get vaccinated. In this exploratory study, we used computer-assisted content analysis techniques, with WordStat software, to identify the most addressed terms, semantic clusters, actors, institutions, and countries in the texts and titles of 716 articles on the COVID-19 vaccine, published by The New York Times (US), The Guardian (United Kingdom), and Folha de São Paulo (Brazil), from January to October 2020. We sought to analyze similarities and differences of countries that stood out by the science denialism stance of their government leaders, reflecting on the severity of the pandemic in these places. Our results indicate that each newspaper emphasized the potential vaccines developed by laboratories in their countries or that have established partnerships with national institutions, but with a more politicized approach in Brazil and a little more technical-scientific approach in the United States and the United Kingdom. In external issues, the newspapers characterized the search for the discovery of a vaccine as a race in which nations and blocs historically marked by economic, political, and ideological disputes are competing, such as the United States, Europe, China, and Russia. The results lead us to reflect on the responsibility of the media to not only inform correctly but also not to create stigmas related to the origin of the vaccine and combat misinformation.', metadata={'title': 'Communicating the “Race” for the COVID-19 Vaccine: An Exploratory Study in Newspapers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil', 'venue': 'Frontiers in Communication', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '1c7af0637fdd3e3ca820fbb4ff8d8a4e4e1f6bb3', 'citationCount': 6, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2021.643895/pdf', 'authors': ['L.

The evaluation of future generation vaccine platforms is the need of the hour. In the majority of nations, innovative technology is being used to hasten the vaccine development process. The evolution of a safe and effective vaccine takes time. The journey from its genesis to making the final product available to the public is a tedious course of action. Vaccines generally function by mimicking the infectious agent, which can be a bacterium, virus, or other microorganisms that cause disease. The characteristic feature of the COVID-19 vaccine development is the use of a wide array of technology platforms, including the virus-like particle, peptide, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), viral vector (replicating and nonreplicating), live attenuated virus, an inactivated virus, and recombinant protein in the process of vaccine preparation. Despite the hurried nature of their current development, all COVID-19 vaccines being developed will receive regulatory approval only if they meet the rigorous safety and efficacy standards. Effective and productive global co-ordination and co-operation between the vaccine developing agencies, regulating authorities, policymakers, governments, funding organizations, and public health bodies are essential to ensure the large-scale manufacturing and equitable distribution of promising end-stage vaccine candidates.

Notably, the first vaccine to be authorized in Italy was the BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine, which has also been approved in the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada. As a matter of fact, RNA vaccines are immunogenic and cost-effective. A 64-year-old woman presented to our department because of a cutaneous lesion on the site where the second dose of the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine was administered 24 h before. The lesion (Figure 1A) consisted in a nodule surrounded by an erythematous halo which was extremely pruritic and painful. Compellingly, the signs persisted for 4 days before disappearing. However, pain and pruritus where still present at follow-up after a week from vaccination. A 56-year-old woman presented with a round erythematous area on the skin on the same site in which she was administered the second dose of the BNT162 vaccine. The manifestation consisted in small vesicular lesions surrounded by erythema (Figure 1B) which had appeared 1 day after the injection. Like the previous instance, pain and pruritus were hallmarks of the condition and persisted even after the disappearance of the cutaneous lesion (a week later). A 60-year-old woman presented severe xerosis and pruritus in the area in which she was injected the BNT162 vaccine. Furthermore, her chest was characterized by extensive erythematous pruritic and painful rash which paralleled the manifestation on the shoulder in onset and duration (Figure 1C). Both started 1 week after the administration and were still present at follow-up 7 days later. None of our patients had a history of allergic reactions to vaccines or medications and the administration of the first dose of the vaccine had not been followed by any adverse event. None of the patients had a history of other dermatologic diseases nor were they being treated with chronic drugs. The three patients were given a topical corticosteroid cream to alleviate the cutaneous manifestations (in patient 1 it was applied under plastic wrap occlusion). Vaccine-related adverse reactions are not rare, with the not immunologically mediated ones being the most prevalent. However, serious anaphylactic events are uncommon. The incidence of severe adverse allergic reactions following the administration of the first dose of the BNT162 vaccine seems to be infrequent. In the USA, of almost 2 million people who received the first dose of the vaccine at the end of December 2020, only 0.001% developed anaphylaxis.

The questionnaire was deployed in an on-line-enabled format (Google form) and conveniently distributed to 685 teachers and 990 students between 15th June, 2022 and 15th August, 2022 which resulted in the participation of 1250 (505 teachers vs.745 students) total respondents (response rate 73.72% vs. 75.25%) from various universities in Bangladesh. A non-parametric analytical tool (binary logistic regression) was applied to rationalize the study objectives and a Chi-squared test was performed to estimate the booster- hesitant risky group. Results The pooled COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance rates were 84.6% (95% CI 81.5─87.7) and 67.2% (95% CI 63.8─70.6) for teachers and students in the university academic community, respectively. In employing a binary logistic regression, this study revealed that out of twelve (12)multi-dimensional key predictors, “equal safety”, “risk-benefit ratio”, and “variant control” had a significant positive association with VBD acceptance in both sets (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.005, respectively). Varied effects were found for several predictors; post-vaccination “side effects” had a significant negative association (p = 0.020) and “community protection” had significant positive association (p = 0.034) with vaccine booster dose acceptance in the teachers community while these variables were insignificant in the students cohort. “Trust” had a highly significant positive association (p = 0.000);“communication” and “academic attainment” had significant positive associations (p = 0.033 and 0.024, respectively) with VBD acceptance in the students cohort, while these predictors were insignificant in the teachers community. Women were more likely to receive a third dose of the vaccine (OR = 1.4 vs. 0.9 between teacher and student model); however, no significant association between gender and booster vaccine acceptance was found in a comparative Chi-squared model. Therefore, statistically, the booster vaccine-hesitant risky group was not found to implicate the massive booster vaccine drive among the university academic community. Conclusions COVID-19 booster vaccine acceptability among the student cohort was slightly lower than pre-roll-out intent. The teacher community was more inclined to get booster vaccinated. Moreover, differences were found between the multi-dimensional potential factors associated with VBD acceptance among teachers and students in university settings. This study explicitly confirmed positive attitudes toward the safety, health benefits, and variants control of the COVID-19 VBD under any circumstances. Post-vaccination side effect concern was found to be a barrier to administering booster shots and a reason for booster skepticism. Tailored communication and health education interventions need to be adopted to improve the public awareness of booster vaccine consequences, and limit booster skepticism.', metadata={'title': 'Multi-dimensional potential factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine booster acceptance and hesitancy among university academic community in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional comparative study', 'venue': 'PLoS ONE', 'year': 2023, 'paperId': 'd2705cb63f4332e6b9a50b4a21dda3d8f5993315', 'citationCount': 1, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281395&type=printable', 'authors': ['D.

       " Document(page_content='Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose in the Thai Setting during the Period of Omicron Variant Predominance;\\n ABSTRACT:The Thai government implemented COVID-19 booster vaccines to prevent morbidity and mortality during the spreading of the Omicron variant. However, little is known about which types of vaccine should be invested in as the booster dose for the Thai population. This study aims to investigate the most cost-effective COVID-19 vaccine for a booster shot as empirical evidence for Thai policymakers. This study applied a stochastic simulation based on a compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model and included system dynamics in the model. We evaluated three scenarios: (1) No booster, (2) A viral vector vaccine as the booster dose, (3) An mRNA vaccine as the booster dose. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on provider perspectives. We found the number of cases in scenarios with viral vector and mRNA booster doses to be lower than in the non-booster group. Likewise, the number of deaths in the viral vector and the mRNA booster scenarios was threefold lower than in the no-booster scenario. Moreover, the estimated grand cost for the no-booster scenario was over 100 billion baht, while viral vector and mRNA scenario costs were 70 and 64.7 billion baht, respectively. ICER shows that viral vector and mRNA scenarios are more cost-effective than the no-booster scenario. Viral vector booster shot appeared to be slightly more cost-effective than mRNA booster shot in terms of death aversion. However, being boosted by an mRNA vaccine seemed slightly more cost-effective than a viral vector vaccine concerning case aversion. In conclusion, policies to promote COVID-19 booster shots in the Thai population by either mRNA or viral vector vaccines are likely to be worthwhile for both economic and public health reasons.', metadata={'title': 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Dose in the Thai Setting during the Period of Omicron Variant Predominance', 'venue': 'Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease', 'year': 2023, 'paperId': '82facc0d0e614ff920176ef9fc43859027a9626a', 'citationCount': 1, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/8/2/91/pdf?version=1676515190', 'authors': ['Kanchanok Sirison', 'Natthaprang Nittayasoot', 'R.

COVID-19 has severely affected the public health by causing more than 200 million cases and four million deaths worldwide. There are, presently, no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. As immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions to prevent this infectious disease, a number of vaccines, around 112, have been developed. In Saudi Arabia, many vaccination campaigns have already started. There are currently four approved COVID-19 vaccines but only three are available for use in Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which a web-based survey was distributed to medical students in their clinical years at the College of Medicine in King Saud bin Abdulaziz University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 209 questionnaires were distributed. The survey assessed the demographic data, perception towards COVID-19 vaccine, barriers and predictors for accepting COVID-19 vaccine. Results Two-hundred and four respondents completed the survey with a response rate of 96.7%. Overall, 118 of the participants were males and 86 were females. Sixty-six percent of our participants had taken the vaccine. Of those, males and females were distributed equally in half. Fifty-three percent of the participants who had taken the vaccine aged 21-23. This age group had a significant effect on acceptance of the vaccine. Most common deterrent to taking COVID-19 vaccine was safety issues despite not having a statistical significance. In terms of motivators, the majority thought that fear of getting COVID-19 infection was the most important motivator to taking COVID-19 vaccine, which was statistically significant as well. Conclusion In the setting of spreading COVID-19 infection, the vaccine is still the solution to halting infection spread. Based on our findings, we see that there was a high acceptance rate (66.2%) of COVID-19 vaccine.', metadata={'title': 'Factors and Determinants for Uptake of COVID-19 Vaccine in a Medical University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia', 'venue': 'Cureus', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': 'aa1f8608f5e3aa26ffb58d20285207565de8aeea', 'citationCount': 7, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/68797/20211006-27326-13a7p9o.pdf', 'authors': ['Bader Altulaihi', 'K.

Despite having both its proponents and critics, the COVID-19 vaccine selfie could positively shape the public response to the vaccines by highlighting health, joy, and optimism.

       " Document(page_content='Hesitancy Towards COVID-19 Vaccine Among Older People in Luzhou, China: A Cross-sectional Study;\\n ABSTRACT:\\n Background:Vaccination is one of the most effective and low-cost health measures to prevent COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy is an obstacle to COVID-19 vaccination. Objective:This study aims to inform the vaccine hesitancy and analyze related factors towards COVID-19 vaccination among elderly in Luzhou, so as to provide suggestions for increasing vaccines uptake. Methods:A face-to-face questionnaire cross-sectional survey was conducted among the elderly people over 60 years old in Luzhou City in April 2021 by multi-stage sampling method. Results: A total of 1047 valid questionnaires were received. 42.0%（440/1047）vaccine hesitancy was reported among elderly in total. Female (OR=1.282, 95%CI:1.003-1.649), live in the rural (OR=3.659, 95%CI:2.813-4.758), poor health (OR=2.318, 95%CI:1.473-3.649), individuals not having regular medical check-ups (OR=2.669, 95%CI:2.072-3.437) and no history of self-funded influenza vaccination ( OR=2.408, 95% CI:1.656-3.502) reported slightly higher vaccine hesitancy. Being in low-risk areas and no need to get vaccinated (OR=16.877, 95%CI:11.750-24.242), being considered that the current protective measures had been able to avoid infection (OR=5.539, 95%CI:3.596-8.532), being considered that the natural immunity get from the disease was better than getting COVID-19 vaccine (OR=5.297, 95%CI:3.666-7.653), being concerned about side effects (OR=5.155, 95%CI:3.655-7.270) and being concerned that the vaccine was ineffective (OR=10.244, 95%CI:6.831-15.362) had higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Those who believing the COVID-19 vaccine was safe and reliable (OR=0.075, 95%CI:0.044-0.130), the vaccine was free (OR=0.466, 95%CI:0.312-0.697) and individuals with higher education (OR=0.189, 95%CI:0.126-0.284) were more willing to get vaccinated. Conclusion: Confidence in vaccines and perceptions of benefits and risk are associated with vaccine hesitancy. It’s very important to strengthen vaccine health literacy education for older people and enhance vaccine confidence. Countries need to supervise the public opinions in social media, television broadcasting and other media, so as to ensure the correct orientation of public opinion. Open and transparent evidence-based information is also needed which can help improve the vaccination coverage rate of the public.', metadata={'title': 'Hesitancy Towards COVID-19 Vaccine Among Older People in Luzhou, China: A Cross-sectional Study', 'venue': '', 'year': 2021, 'paperId': '9bb4199c7bea89c30a122e71fb6eea544e2a4085', 'citationCount': 2, 'openAccessPdf': 'https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-757239/latest.pdf', 'authors': ['Jianlan Ren', 'Yu Zheng', 'Yue Luo', 'Mei Li', 'Ren-Sheng Xie', 'Daiying Zhang'], 'externalIds': {'MAG': '3194605072', 'DOI': '10.21203/rs.3.rs-757239/v1', 'CorpusId': 238654934}})]"
