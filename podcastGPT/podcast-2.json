Hello, and welcome to another episode of Emerging Markets Decoded, Moody's bi-weekly podcast on all things related to emerging markets. My name is Scott Phillips, Head of EM at Moody's and I'm joined today by an old colleague of mine, Kojo Amu-Godfried, who is now Chief Investment Officer at Blackstars Investments, a global alternatives advisory firm focused on EM. Now, as ever, the views expressed by Kojo are his own, and do not reflect those of Moody's Investor Service. And I'm also delighted to say I'm joined by Vittorio Zolli from the EM team at Moody's. Now we're recording this podcast in August and with market activity slowing down into the summer, I wanted to take the opportunity of reassessing where we are, both from a macro perspective, but also from an investor perspective, looking across all three pillars of the EM investable universe, local currency, EM sovereigns and EM corporates. Now regular listeners will know that Moody's views on credit conditions have been pretty steady over the course of this year. Back in January, we expected financial conditions to tighten, and for the growth outlook to deteriorate across EM, with the main standout being of course, China. And for the most part, I think this outlook has proved generally correct, albeit with China's growth outlook looking increasingly uncertain. Now, having said that, we've all seen actually the growth indicators looking a little bit more optimistic recently, and inflation seems seemingly under control, at least in emerging markets. So it does seem opportune to ask once again, is this the start of a new emerging markets renaissance? Now we've got Vittorio and Kojo here today. Welcome both of you to the podcast. Hi, Scott. Thank you very much for having us. Pleasure to be here, Scott. Great. So as ever, let's get right into it. So maybe Kojo, we can kick off with a bit of an introduction about yourself and Blackstar's investments. What is your focus area? And why did you set up BSI? So after university, I went into investment banking, and I rotated on different desks. I did banking for four years, and I ended up in the prop trading team. And I had no prior experience of banking, so I didn't really know what exactly I wanted to do. But at that stage, I knew I wanted to be an investor. So after that, I went to business school, and after business school, I went straight into a hedge fund. So I've been in hedge funds for the last 10 years, won multiple awards, and has really strong high returns. And so I made a natural progression to set up BSI. And the aim of BSI is to invest in EM, but in a very pragmatic way. So we're going to do hard currency local, but also the corporate as well. So think of us as a best ideas EM shop. So that's pretty much the genesis of BSI. I mean, in terms of how we do or what we do, we tend to specialize particularly in the frontier markets, because these tend to be markets that tend not to be very well covered, both by the buy side or the sell side. They tend to be smaller, tend to be less liquid, but also less understood. So it gives you a lot of opportunities to create an alpha. Got it. No, that sounds exciting. And I guess are you investing globally, right? I mean, frontier markets, but also EM, but across all the major regions? Exactly. So we do both traditional EM, so the likes of your Brazil, your Mexico's, your Turkey's, and also the frontier markets, so places in Africa, Azerbaijan, the Caribbean, etc. Okay, awesome. So maybe let's just get your view on EM more generally at this point. I mean, I talked a little bit in the introduction that investors, I think, have been waiting on the sidelines looking for more of a clearer view on the monetary policy side, the growth side. It was certainly a very weak 2022. And I think that sentiment is certainly stabilizing, right? So I mean, is that your view? Are you more bullish, more bearish? And what are probably the catalysts that you're looking out for? I think that's a very interesting question. It's something that's come up quite a lot, as you can imagine. 2022 was probably one of the worst years in EM for the last decade, maybe two decades. I do think this year is better, but I'm actually very bullish on emerging markets. I think we're definitely starting to see a renaissance. The key question is what is going to be the main catalyst? So for last year, the big issue was obviously US rates. And that is one of the biggest issues for emerging markets. So you saw that obviously long duration did much worse last year than obviously shorter duration. This year is slightly trickier. So it is still macro dominated. Everyone's waiting to see what's going to happen to global yields. And EM is unfortunately right now being a subset of that reaction function. Over time, it's going to go down to the different intricacies between different individual EM credits. But for now, it's really more being driven by the beta. And if you look at the data, the data is actually quite mixed. So as seen in the US, we can see that inflation is definitely plateauing. It's gone from 9% in July 2022. And recent figures for US inflation was 3%. So clearly inflation is coming down. But it's not as simple, because if you look at the data in detail, the base effects are starting to wear off. So what you can see is that US inflation may actually just plateau. And it's unlikely to keep dropping further on a monthly basis. And secondly, if you also look globally, you've seen that commodities have started to go up as well. So gold is now up around $1,900. And oil prices have gone up to $84. Of course, supported by the OPEC cuts. So generally, we are optimistic. We do think that EM is incredibly undervalued. So we think that there's tremendous opportunities, both in credit rates and FX. But it's trying to find the optimal time to be very aggressive. That's what's key. Exactly. So within risky assets, the combination of a more benign Fed outlook, a general weak weakening of the dollar and resilient EM growth relatively to developed markets, seems to suggest that sentiments towards emerging markets will continue to improve. So I'm interested here to know your general macro perspective at this point. It seems as if the consensus position of a soft landing in the US and a generally robust growth outlook for most emerging markets with inflation continuing to fall is well entrenched. How does your view differ? And what are some of the regional dynamics at play? Very good question. I'm splitting it to the consensus and then the regional dynamics. In terms of consensus, we do agree the consensus. We do think we've seen disinflation across the board, both in the US, both in Europe and also in the UK. But we're also not too sure whether now is the time to be super aggressive, because although we've seen inflation numbers come down, like some of the basic effects, it's not guaranteed to keep coming down as significantly as it has the last few months. What gives us confidence is we've seen the US labor market, the labor market is weakening. I mean, six months ago, non-farm payrolls were around $470,000 every month. Recent was about $190,000. So US labor market is definitely weakening. But one good number doesn't make a trend. So I mean, let's trade this. We've got to do this on the basis of probability. So we're optimistic. We see evidence of disinflation happening, but we're not sure it's actually there yet for us to be very aggressive. And if you look at central banks as well, so obviously Brazil and Chile led the hiking cycle in EM before the Fed decided to hike. We look at it now, and Brazil and Chile have both cut rates. But recently, the Czech National Bank decided not to cut. Why? Because they wanted to wait and get more information first. And as you can see, obviously the Fed is also on a pause as well. So we do think we're very close to a paradigm shift. And at that stage, EM is going to be incredibly cheap, and it's going to have a huge run in EM. But knowing that precise point is still slightly tricky. To your second point on the regional dynamics, I mean, this is something that we've always found fascinating because we invest in Africa, Asia, South America, and also Eastern Europe as well. For us, we've been very aggressive in Eastern Europe. We think that's been incredibly undervalued. And part of it has been down to a relic of the Ukraine war. So a lot of people initially just decided to be very defensive and avoid the region. We think certain countries offer tremendous value. Turkey, Romania, Hungary, we think there's tremendous value there. Is that both on the credit side and the local macro side, or just on the credit side? Definitely on the credit side. On the local side, we have similar views, just not to the same degree, but definitely on the credit side. In Asia, within the market, it's probably fairly valued. So there's been a lot of noise about what's going on in India right now, which we keep quite a close eye on. We do think the GC is quite attractive, particularly in the corporate space as well. So Asia, we're involved, but we're not very aggressive there. Africa is a place we're extremely aggressive because, I mean, we think the amount of alpha you can create in Africa is basically unparalleled. We do think that on the corporate side, a lot of African financials are fundamentally misplaced. And we look at some of the valuations, and when you compare that to the fundamentals, we just think that some of these are truly amazing opportunities. So you have senior debt, trade and double-digit yields, and these are tier one banks. So we look at this as something very attractive. We also think in the telco space, because of a lack of understanding of some of these names, and because of such an unduly unfair high-risk premium, a lot of these names are trading incredibly attractively. So Africa is a place where we see a lot of value, both in corporates and also in sovereigns. South America is the place where we have the most internal debate. So we bullish on Eastern Europe, bullish on Africa, quite neutral on Asia. So in South America, we see a lot of value in local. I think that's a consensus trade. It's more the hard currency because we have certain names that we feel, and this is performing credit, that we feel are very attractive, but we keep getting quite a lot of pushback from other investors or the sell side as well. On the distress side, names like Ecuador, Venezuela, Argentina, going to another IMF program. We see value in distress, but it's not a place that we play in that much, just more because we like liquidity. But on some other names, they're more conventional names, the Mexicos, the Brazils, they're very traditional benchmark names. We still see some value. So our aim right now is really to arbitrage between different EM regions to get the best ideas and invest in those markets. Okay. I mean, that's a really interesting sort of country by country perspective. And I wanted to sort of develop on that because, you know, I think really starting in May, we've seen a pretty big rally across most risk assets, right? I mean, more than a hundred basis point move in high yield for both EM sovereigns and EM corporates. I think personally, this has been driven a lot by, you know, really the lower rate is part of the spectrum. So I guess the question to you is, you know, how much of that do you think was really driven by, you know, technical factors versus, say, fundamental factors, you know, from a purely markets perspective? Because I guess in some of the African countries, for example, you know, Ghana, Zambia, we've seen some, I think, positive moves after the progress on the restructuring talks. I think there's some positivity that came out of the Nigerian election. So, you know, there are some, you know, fundamental reasons if you like. But what's your view more generally when looking across EM? A lot of it has really been down to the lowest rating names. So clearly Egypt, Zambia, Zambia Ghana obviously restructuring, Egypt, Tunisia. Tunisia in particular is quite surprising. There's been this view that a lot of these things have been so badly hit that reality is going to be a lot better. So you see a lot of mean reversion. And that's kind of the main aim you've seen in all these names. Pakistan has also rallied quite a bit, which has been a bit surprising. Sri Lanka has done well, obviously positive restructuring because people realize that, you know, things are not going to be as bad as they have earlier expected. I mean, our view is we don't see a lot of inflows into EM compared to historical data. So there's still a lag in terms of where EM should truly be valued. So we view this move now as basically one stage in the whole process of the EM re-evaluation trade. So this is basically those have been the worst hit, obviously recovering earlier, as you mentioned, obviously the CCC names. We do think there are more stages to come. We do think that once a lot of the fund flow data comes back in and we get more of the marginal investors back into EM, we're going to see more of a rally, both the distressed names to more of the performing names and also to the benchmark IG names as well. So we do think this is basically just stage one in the process of the EM recovery. But we do need a few more catalysts, and I do think that some stability in global rates would help. And then once that happens, we're going to start people trying to identify EM names on a name by name basis. So it's not just going to be the lowest rated, but probably start to invest on a name by name basis. Now, that's great, Kojo. Thanks. Thanks a lot for that. So I want to switch gears now and talk about a theme that we've been really developing, you know, in our research and on the podcast over the course of this year. And that's around India as a rising EM powerhouse. And I think you mentioned it as well earlier. You know, obviously, I think the China growth story is well known. We've talked a lot about the potential benefits of China's reopening this year and essentially also the slightly underwhelming effect that that's had across EM, particularly the last few months. So maybe just start with India. I mean, do you have a general view on India's growth outlook? And what does that mean for EM when you're thinking about the transmission channels? I mean, that's a really good question. It's something that we're discussing. We haven't come to consensus yet, because when it comes to India, there's so many different factors. And so the first one, the India story has come up at least three or four times over the last decade. The India rising is going to take over from China. So we've heard this so many times before, and it's never really happened. So we do have a bit of fatigue about that story. So that's the first thing to say. Secondly, some of the metrics are good. I mean, growth of 6% is impressive. Their current account looks like it's improving to, I think, 2% deficit from the amount of 6% before. But you've also got to look at it cautiously, because is the current account improvement genuine and structural? Or is it a short-term flip due to what's happening in Ukraine? So that kind of gives us a bit of pause to think about, is this really a true sustained rally? Or is it just a short-term issue? We also have some concerns about the political system. So Modi is quite a divisive figure, and his party is very popular in the North. In the South, they're not as popular. And he recently lost a key election in the South. So is he going to get re-elected in the next elections, which are next year in 2024? So that gives us something to think about. And will he even be able to maintain policy continuity? Because that's something that is not guaranteed, which it is in China. Because whether you like the Chinese political system or not, they do tend to think long-term and have the ability to execute long-term visions. Whereas India, being a democracy, tends to be a bit more short-termist. So the lack of clarity about the fundamentals, the political instability, it makes us a bit more cautious. One thing that's come to attention recently, and we think most people in the markets have missed out, is quite left-field. It's also heat. And India's having quite a lot of heatwaves recently. So parts of India are now viewed as being unlivable, having temperatures around like in the high 40s. Basically in the late 30s, now high 40s, mostly in Northern India. Particularly a state called Uttar Pradesh. And there's something that came to attention about a few months ago. We're monitoring it. And it seems to be increasing. Now we're looking at what's going to happen with global warming and the increased incidence of floods. And if you think that it's going to reach a point where parts of the country are going to get so hot they're unlivable, then the economic activity is probably going to move more towards the south of the country, which tends to be more against the current president, the current prime minister. So we like what we see so far in the numbers. We think there's definitely been a big improvement. But what we're trying to think about is, can they maintain this for the next 10, 20 years? Because that's how you're going to see a transformation. If GDP grows about 5%, population grows about 1%, then of course per capita you're going to see improvement. But for right now, we're in the camp of less wait and see, because we see a lot of good, positive trends. But they're not guaranteed to maintain. We're not sure what it's going to be there for the next 5, 10 years either. So all these things make us a bit cautious about what's going to end here. And lastly, I'm sure you remember the whole issue with Andani and how hard that situation is. And there seems to be a bit of, let's just say, lack of clarity between how closely embedded some of the big businesses are with the government. So again, our view is we want to fully understand how that's going to work. Are they going to be state-owned companies? Are they going to be similar to the Chinese model? Is it a different model? How is state capitalism going to work? So all these things make us think we like India, particularly the banks. We think the banks are fairly valid. But we're not certain yet whether India is in a situation where it can really replace China. Now, let me jump in here, Kojo. We just talked about the macro outlook for the US and EM as well. I was wondering whether we could change a little bit perspective and focus on EM corporates. How resilient do you think EM corporates are to your macro outlook? And are there any sectors that you like to call out? Also, I would think it makes sense here to have also a regional breakdown. In terms of the born-yields, one thing we've noticed in particular for this year is despite EM doing quite well, EM is up about 2% to 4% so far in the first half, US rates have actually gone up this year. So most of the gains we've seen in EM has actually been down to spread compression. So basically, the spread of EM corporates has actually contracted. So there's still scope for more value when rates start to normalize and volatility goes down. So we have seen some EM outperformance, but there's still a lot more to come. In terms of sectors, we actually think that EM corporates tend to be extremely undervalued because most people view them as a proxy to the sovereign. So if they're not confident in the sovereign, they're not going to invest in the corporates, irrespective of the credit quality of the individual corporate. Personally, we're very big fans of financial services and also telcos. Those are two sectors we think are incredibly undervalued. So when it comes to telcos, a lot of people are worried about political risk. What they tend to ignore is that even in elections, even when there's political upheaval, people still need to communicate. So if you look at most telecompanies, look at the financials, even in situations where there's a coup, there's political upheaval, their services are uninterrupted. Why? Because both parties want to be able to communicate. So telcos tend to be quite recession-proof or isopolitical risk-proof. And financial services, because of their importance in most EM, because most EM are actually trying to develop their economies, tend to be quite important. And about 10, 20 years ago, actually maybe 30 years ago, people were worried about EM banks.,Since then, we've seen quite a huge improvement in banks. So NPLs tend to be much, much smaller, much lower than historical, to around like 5% to 8% compared to maybe 20% in the past. A lot of EM banks also have a lot of provisioning in advance, and the regulators tend to be quite aggressive. So if you look at a lot of EM banks, their capital ratios tend to be a lot higher than in developed banks. Some have ratios around 15%, 20%, which is quite impressive. And they're also quite profitable. So there's a lot of internally generated capital as well. So for our view, EM banks are actually very, very well capitalized. They're profitable and have no NPLs. So we see tremendous value there. And ironically, I'm sure you remember earlier in the year, where there were the issues with AT1s in Europe, and that had a spillover effect into EMAT1s, even though there was no direct relevance. So I mean, obviously, being the investor that we are, we know what we're doing next, and you've obviously seen quite a big recovery in EMAT1s. So in our view, there's tremendous value in emerging market corporates, but of course, it's one market where you've got to pick and choose correctly, because that particular name matters a lot. And also on a geographical basis, there's huge diversity. So you have the ones in, let's say the GCC, well, very well capitalized banks, huge balance sheets, and you have perpetual bonds giving 6%, 5%, incredibly tight rates. I have others in other parts of the world giving you 10%, 12%. So again, for AT1 bonds. So in terms of the entire spectrum, there's tremendous diversity, and it's really more about the credit selection. You mentioned some of the Chinese names. That is a market we've probably found the hardest to crack, because of A, a lack of information, and also B, a lack of clarity about the government policy. We keep hearing rumors about how there's gonna be a lot of support for the Chinese property sector. So that is our base case, because we think that's important for them, and they want to maintain public support. But we haven't seen anything consistent that's come out here for us to be guaranteed that's gonna happen. And one thing also to factor in is the impact of the corporates also on the macro. So everyone's worried about the Chinese property sector maybe imploding, and obviously China having a big debt issue locally. Now if you've seen what happened in Japan in the past, that also led to deflation on the macro basis. And we've heard rumors over the last couple of weeks that China's now starting to explore deflation as well. So if you factor in that going from the micro to the macro, and China starts to explore deflation globally, then that might have a big impact on the global inflation picture, and that could also have impacts on EM prices. Got it. Can I just pick up on one of your points you made just then, actually? It was around the trading performance, if you like, of, you called out financial services, you called out telcos versus the sovereign. I mean, is that spread pickup you see consistent across the regions, or does it vary quite a lot? Good question. It definitely tends to vary. So in certain places, you get at least a good 200, 300 basis points premium for the corporate of a sovereign, unless it's a bit tighter, maybe about 50 basis points. And it also depends on how big the local corporates are, how many issues they have, and also how advanced the local domestic capital markets are, because in some markets, the local investors are very savvy, they understand these corporates, know them well, and they're quite happy to take corporate risk, whereas others tend to be more conservative and only just invest in the sovereigns. I mean, one thing I like to point out, and particularly for a rating agency, is that we do think that quite a few EM corporates should be able to pierce the sovereign ceiling. And I know historically, that's been quite... That's a topic for a whole other podcast, actually. I understand, but as we invest, we do invest in a few of them because we think that some of the corporates are actually better credit than the underlying sovereign. Got it. That's certainly a very complex question that I think deserves more time. I want to finish just on a slightly different point, though, and I'm going to come back to it. It's one of my favorite topics. It's around EM local corporates, right? You and I have talked about it before, but what would it take for more international investors to consider local and local and corporate? Now, this is a very, very difficult question, probably the hardest one so far. It makes us a lot of different things, and I think that's why a lot of investors struggle with this. A lot of investors internationally, so let's say offshore investors, like to invest either in sovereigns or in corporates, one or the other. And most investors in EM local currency invest in sovereigns. So to convince a foreign investor to invest in local currency, so they want to take on the currency risk and also take on credit risk. So it's that combination which makes for a lot of foreign investors quite concerned and quite worried about doing so, particularly when you compare that to the options that they have in the dollar market. So you can buy EM corporate bonds and make double-digit returns from it. You can actually buy some EM sovereigns, obviously the high-yield ones, and also make similar returns. So I think when you take on the currency risk, which you may not be able to hedge, and then take on corporate risk also in the market and have the fact where there's also the informational asymmetry as well. So it's not easy to persuade a lot of investors to go into that market. I've had quite a few DCM desk come reach out to me in the past about these offerings. I've actually invested in a few of those, and there was one that came from Ghana as well, and I might go into the roadshow and speak to other investors, and there was quite a bit of feedback because a lot of people were quite concerned about taking on both FX and also credit risk locally. So I think until that is, until there's a way that people get comfortable with it too, either because it might be a frequent issuer or it might be a highly-rated issuer, or maybe an issuer that is well-established in the dollar curve, and they decide to do something low-currency, so a frequent issuer per se, then there might be some interest. But I think that's probably the Holy Grail of EM, the part of EM that's, the market that's really the most misunderstood at the moment. I mean, I guess certainly for the most part, it's the domain of the local pension funds, local institutional investors, to the extent they exist, right? Very limited international participation. Exactly. And most local pension funds and local institutions, they tend to prefer sovereign debt. And also, that's also because they do get some capital allowances when you buy a government paper. It comes with capital ratios, which corporate debt doesn't give you. So in that sense, they have very little incentive. And the spread picker might be maybe 2% or 3%. So for them, it doesn't really make much difference. And for you as a foreign investor, you're not gonna get more than 30% or so. So for a lot of people, they look at it as, they see the value, but they don't think it's priced appropriately for the double risk you take. I mean, for us, we are opportunistic. So we look at everything. And we think there's something that makes sense. We will look at it. But we do know we're in a minority in that sense. Got it. All right. Well, I think we better leave it there for today. It's been fascinating talking to you, Kojo, and hearing your insights. Thank you for listening to us today.
