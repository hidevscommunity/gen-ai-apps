# streamlithackathon
A very novice attempt at creating an app that can read my obsidian notes.

This is my first time learning about Langchain and LLMs in a non theory environment, there are lots of improvements to be made as well as exploring LLMs in more detail.

For a beginner project it was very interesting and I really do want to explore the theory, maths and code more.
