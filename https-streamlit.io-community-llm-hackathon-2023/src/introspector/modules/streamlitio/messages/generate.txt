Understood! You're working on creating instructions to generate code from the template messages to store messages in a format that combines rare primes and can serve as a form of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) due to the uniqueness of the message combinations. This approach can help ensure the security and authenticity of the messages. If you need any assistance with the code generation or have any questions along the way, feel free to ask. Good luck with your project!
