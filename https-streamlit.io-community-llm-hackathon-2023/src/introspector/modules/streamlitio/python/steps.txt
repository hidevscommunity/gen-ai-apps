Creating a Streamlit application to bootstrap your knowledge representation system is a great idea! Streamlit makes it relatively easy to develop interactive web applications with Python. Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:

1. **Install Streamlit**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Streamlit. You can do this using pip:

   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Create a Streamlit App File**: Create a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) where you'll write your Streamlit application code.

3. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries, including Streamlit and any other libraries you need for your project.

4. **Define Your UI**: Use Streamlit widgets to define the user interface of your application. You can create text inputs, buttons, sliders, and other UI components to interact with your knowledge representation system.

5. **Backend Logic**: Write the backend logic of your application. This is where you'll implement the functionality that interacts with your knowledge representation system. You can define functions that perform specific tasks or computations based on user input.

6. **Display Results**: Use Streamlit's methods to display results, such as tables, charts, or any other output that your knowledge representation system generates.

7. **Run the App**: To run your Streamlit app, use the following command in your terminal while in the project directory:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

8. **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously iterate and improve your Streamlit application based on user feedback and your evolving knowledge representation system.
