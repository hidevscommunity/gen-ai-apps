## Welcome to the Chat with your YouTube Video App

This app enables you to chat with YouTube videos in an interactive manner. It not only lets you process a video but also directs you to specific parts of the video with timestamps during the chat. Here's how you can use the app:

### Chat with a YouTube Video

1. **URL Input**: Enter the YouTube video URL in the designated field.
2. **Language Selection**: Choose the language of the video from the dropdown menu. This will help the app to process the video accurately.
3. **Process Video**: Click the **Process Video** button to start the preprocessing of the video. This might take a few moments.
4. **Start Chatting**: Once the video has been processed, you can start chatting with it. Type your query or statement in the chat box and press Enter.
5. **Timestamp References**: The answers from the chat will include timestamp references (`[[timestamp]]`) that link to the corresponding sections in the video.
6. **Show Video Section**: Expand the "Show Video" section and click on the timestamp reference. This will display the corresponding video segment for your reference.
