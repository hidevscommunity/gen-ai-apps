## 📦 Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture with separate components for different functionalities such as background, popup, content, and components. The use of React components allows for easy reusability and composition. The codebase also includes event-driven programming with listeners and callbacks to handle user interactions and system events. Overall, the architecture is well-structured and organized.    |
| **📃 Documentation**   | The codebase has limited documentation. While some files have brief comments explaining their functionality, there is no comprehensive documentation or README file explaining the overall project, its features, and how to set it up or contribute to it. Improved documentation would make it easier for developers to understand and contribute to the project.    |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on several external dependencies, including esbuild, esbuild-sass-plugin, softprops/action-gh-release, ReactDOM, and various React libraries. These dependencies provide critical functionality such as transpilation, bundling, release automation, rendering React components, and managing CSS. The use of these dependencies enhances productivity and allows for the adoption of best practices.    |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase exhibits good modularity by organizing functionality into smaller, interchangeable components. Each component is responsible for a specific task, such as background, popup, content, or components. This modular approach enhances maintainability, reusability, and testability. However, some components could benefit from further decoupling and separation of concerns to improve code readability and ease of maintenance.    |
| **🧪 Testing**          | The codebase does not include any testing strategies or tools. The lack of tests makes it difficult to ensure the correctness and stability of the codebase. Incorporating testing frameworks such as Jest or Cypress and writing unit tests and end-to-end tests would significantly improve the quality and reliability of the project.    |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | The performance of the system depends on various factors such as the efficiency of the external libraries used and the complexity of the logic implemented. Without performance-specific code or benchmarks, it is difficult to make definitive claims about the system's performance. However, leveraging tools like performance profiling and optimization techniques can help in ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimal speed.    |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not have explicit security measures mentioned in the provided information. Given that this is an AI chatbot assistant system, it is crucial to consider security aspects such as handling user inputs, protecting sensitive data, and securing communication with external APIs. Implementing measures like input validation, secure communication protocols (HTTPS), and user authentication can enhance the security of the system.    |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control. The presence of a GitHub repository suggests the use of Git workflows and branch management. The provided information does not mention specific version control strategies or tools being used. The adoption of branching models like GitFlow and utilizing features like pull requests and code reviews can enhance collaboration and code quality.    |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase integrates with external systems and services such as Chrome and Firefox browsers, chatbot APIs, and the browser's speech synthesis API. The integration with these systems allows for enhanced functionality and features like voice-controlled AI
