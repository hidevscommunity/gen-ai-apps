Toy Story Midway Mania! (also known as Toy Story Mania!) is an interactive 4-D theme park attraction, located at three Disney theme parks: Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort, Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort and Tokyo DisneySea at Tokyo Disney Resort.

Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and inspired by Disney·Pixar's Toy Story franchise, the attraction was first unveiled during a press conference at Walt Disney World in January 2007. The Florida version was officially opened by Tim Allen on May 31, 2008, on the same date that the Buzz Lightyear action figure launched onboard Space Shuttle flight STS-124 (whose objective was to deliver the largest module of the space station - Kibō, the Japanese Experiment Module pressurized section, developed by JAXA),[1][2] while the California version officially opened on June 17, 2008.[3][4] The Japan version of the attraction opened on July 9, 2012.[5]

Concept
Park guests wear 3-D glasses (Carnival Games Goggles) aboard spinning vehicles that travel through virtual environments based on classic carnival midway games.[6][7] Ride vehicles seat up to eight in four back-to-back pairs. Small children are also able to ride on an adult's lap if they are facing forward with their legs securely underneath the safety bar.

Mini-games
The attraction features five mini-games after a practice round, where the player can hit targets from 100 to 5,000 points. Each mini game includes at least one "Easter egg" that can trigger additional targets or gameplay changes. In order, the games are:

Pie Throw Practice Booth (pie toss target practice game, a no points introduction)
Hamm & Eggs (egg throw game featuring Hamm and Buttercup from Toy Story 3)
Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts (dart throw game; replaced Bo Peep's Baa-loon Pop)
Green Army Men Shoot Camp (baseball throw / plate breaking game)
Buzz Lightyear's Flying Tossers (ring toss game)
Woody's Rootin' Tootin' Shootin' Gallery (suction cup shooting game)
Each guest's score is recorded by an onboard display screen as points are acquired with individual toy cannons firing simulated projectiles at virtual targets. Toy Story characters including Woody, Hamm, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Trixie and many more characters appear during the attraction's different games.

Similar technology had been used in Disney attractions such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold at DisneyQuest and several Buzz Lightyear attractions. According to Disney, it is the first attraction created simultaneously by Walt Disney Imagineering for two theme parks.[8]

The line at both parks features a large Mr. Potato Head Audio-Animatronic figure that interacts with guests through pre-recorded snippets of dialogue performed by late comedian Don Rickles, who voiced the character in the Toy Story films. The sophisticated figure identifies people in the audience, sings and tells jokes.

Former mini-games
Only five mini-games can be used at a time. So far, only one game has left the attraction. On May 21, 2010, the original dart throwing game, Bo Peep's Baaa-loon Pop, was replaced with "Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts" (updated with the release of Toy Story 3).[9]

Technology
At its debut, Toy Story Midway Mania! was one of the most technologically sophisticated attractions yet developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, costing an estimated $80 million to design and build.[6] It marked the company's first use of industrial Ethernet for a ride's control system.[13] Many of the parts for the attraction's control system came from two of Disney's corporate sponsors, Siemens AG (from Spaceship Earth) and Hewlett-Packard (from Mission: Space).[13] The ride was the biggest system that had been built at the time and ran on one of Disney's most advanced automation systems to date.[14]

The control system is divided into three components: one for the ride vehicles, one for the games and one more for the attraction's special effects.[13] Programmable logic controllers in the vehicles alert the control system wirelessly via ProfiNET RT to the vehicle's speed and location. The central controller then sends its instructions back to the vehicles using a hard-wired network within the track. The one-way communications flow adds a factor of safety, even though the wireless network is protected against outside interference, such as a denial-of-service attack.[13]

The attraction features more than 150 PCs, which includes one HP Windows XP PC for each of Midway Mania's 56 game screens, as well as others that control the special effects at each game.[13] At the game screens, two tracking systems provide the game control system with the vehicle's exact location, making sure that gameplay is not affected by even minor differences in vehicle position. According to Jody Gerstner, executive director of show and ride controls, "The game doesn’t care if the car parks in the same spot every time. It just needs to know where each car has actually parked, and it can compensate."[13] Additional sensors in the spring-action shooter provide information on its orientation, which is fine-tuned using data on the position of the ride vehicle at the screen and the rotation of the seats on the vehicle base.[13]

All three sub-systems work together to handle any contingency. For example, if a delay or other vehicle stoppage is detected (such as might occur if the loading and unloading of the ride vehicles is taking longer than expected), the control system can command the affected game screens to launch a non-scoring practice round, so that guests may continue to shoot targets while they wait. Similarly, it can instruct the show control system to play an audio spiel telling guests about the delay.[13]

As the games are software-based, changes can be made to the attraction's lineup of games without significant effort. In April 2010, Disney Parks announced plans to replace Bo Peep's Baaa-loon Pop with Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts. The change took place on May 21, 2010.[15] The new game includes one of the new characters from the Toy Story 3 feature film, which was released in June 2010.[15]

Locations

Toy Story Midway Mania at Disney California Adventure in 2009
Disney California Adventure: Pixar Pier, beneath the Incredicoaster roller coaster, a space formerly occupied by themed midway games and food service locations. The area is designed to resemble a Victorian-era seaside carnival. Pixar Pier replaced Paradise Pier on June 23, 2018, and the attraction located in California is the main attraction of a "Toy Story" themed area in the new land.
Disney's Hollywood Studios: Toy Story Land, inside the studios' former soundstages, which were most recently used for the park's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It! attraction. The original facade, as well as the original surrounding area, resembles Pixar Animation Studios' campus in Emeryville, California. The attraction's entrance was relocated to Toy Story Land on June 30, 2018, with the Pixar Place area closing.
Tokyo DisneySea: Located in the New York area of the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park.
Operational changes
In October 2014, Disney's Hollywood Studios began testing a new procedure that would require all riders to have FastPass reservations for the attraction.[16] The test, scheduled to last only a few days, eliminated the standby line that is used by visitors who have not already obtained a FastPass ticket for the ride, either because they had all been claimed or they were holding FastPasses for other attractions.[16] Some analysts suggest that this process could become more common in years to come as amusement parks attempt to keep guests from getting frustrated or waiting in extremely long lines.[16]

Name variation
The attraction is being referred to as both Toy Story Midway Mania! and Toy Story Mania!. While the attraction marquees and some in-park signage read the former, the latter has been used in press releases to the news media,[17][18] used in both resorts' advertisements, and on the disneyland.com, disneyworld.com, and official promotional website for the attraction, along with attraction merchandise. Websites for both Disneyland and Walt Disney World both identified the attraction with the registered trademark "Toy Story Midway Mania!" as of September 2014. As of February 2019, the attraction is known as "Toy Story Mania!", except for the Disney California Adventure version which is still known as “Toy Story Midway Mania!”

Music
Music for the queue area was arranged and recorded by Jennifer Hammond at Capitol Studios with a live orchestra. More than an hour of music was recorded, all based on the first two Toy Story scores composed by Randy Newman.[19]

Merchandising
Disney Interactive Studios released a Toy Story Mania! video game in September 2009 exclusively for the Nintendo Wii console.[20] The game features gameplay and levels similar to those in the theme park attractions, along with original levels and features.[20] Jakks Pacific also released their "Plug It In & Play TV Game" version of Toy Story Mania! in 2010 featuring the original levels & Infini-D technology (Infini-D glasses are included). A version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was released on October 30, 2012, and developed by High Voltage Software.[21]

Now that Toy Story 3 is out, it’s time to talk about my all time favorite ride at Disney; Toy Story Mania! at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. This attraction combines fun elements of my childhood with my competitive personality and makes me live for the one time in my bi-monthly trips I get to enjoy this ride.

When I enter this ride, I feel like I am walking into my toy closet as a child. As the line queue winds through the attraction on its way up to the beginning of the ride, I feel like I have been transported back in time. All of my favorites are here: Candy Land, Lincoln Logs, Chutes and Ladders, Mr. Potato Head, and even oversized, larger-than-life crayons. It is a kid’s (and adult’s) dream. The vibrant colors, the sheer joy of knowing I WILL beat my last score, and just enjoying the atmosphere with other people in line, puts me in a blissful place. Not every line at Disney does this for me; I can promise you that. I have, however; met some of the nicest people at this ride, and the line never seems as long as it says. With that said, there are a couple of rules to go by when going on Toy Story Mania! to make your experience the best it can be.

First (and most importantly), go early in the day! I can’t stress this enough. Do not wait until later in the day to come over to Hollywood Studios thinking you will be able to hop right on and ride. This ride gets long very fast and stays long all day.
Once you enter the park, go straight to this ride. Don’t even stop to Fast Pass Tower of Terror or Rock ‘n Rollercoaster. Rockin’s line moves quicker than any other and you will still be able to get a good time if you Fastpass it after Toy Story Mania!
If you are thinking of Fastpassing this ride and waiting until later to ride it, you might want to reconsider. This ride has a tendency to break down occasionally and it may take 45 minutes or longer to reset. While resetting, they typically do not allow people to wait inside the building. This means that even with a Fastpass, you may still end up waiting for a while to ride.
 Do not make the mistake of thinking you are in line for the ride, only to find out 20 minutes later that you are actually in line for the Fastpass machine. Both lines can be long! You have to walk past the Fastpass booths to get to the ride line, which is to the left of the entrance as you are looking at the door.  
Accuracy vs. total score. If you are going for a high score, keep pulling the trigger (string). You will not be penalized for missed shots, so keep on shooting.  
Ride secrets for higher scores. Each of the arcade games has its own secret tips to release higher scoring targets. Here are a few of them.
The Barn. Shoot the fox in the lower left corner to release a flock of high-scoring chickens in the same corner.

Plate Toss. Shoot both ‘jumping’ plates to initiate a screen full of high-scoring jumping plates. Once the screen clears, four jumping plates will appear. Along with your partner, shoot these four plates. If successful, the mountain will lift to reveal a tank.

Alien Ring Toss. Put rings on all eight of the aliens in the center spaceship before they reappear. If you do, the spaceship will take off to reveal a super alien, worth a whole lot of points.

Woody’s Roundup. Shooting the bullseyes will make them blossom into a tree of targets. Shoot all of these quickly to initiate new high-value targets. Also, Shoot the small bat near the top to activate a new really high-value target.

After going on this ride, I think you will see why it is one of my favorite rides in all of Walt Disney World. Whether you are competitive like me or just there to sit back and enjoy the ride, I believe this ride will soon be in your list of top attractions too. Enjoy.

Premise
The ride has a giant animatronic Mr. Potato Head who entertains the people waiting in line. Park guests wear 3-D glasses (or Carnival Games Goggles) aboard spinning vehicles that travel through virtual environments based on midway games.[7][8] The attraction features five mini-games after a practice round, each of which includes at least one "Easter egg" that can trigger additional targets or gameplay changes. These games are:

Hamm & Eggs - Hamm and Buttercup (replacing Rex after the release of Toy Story 3) invite you to knock down both moving and stationary barnyard animal targets using hardboiled eggs.
Rex & Trixie's Dino Darts (originally Bo Peep's Baaa-loon Pop prior to the release of Toy Story 3) - Launch darts and pop balloons in front of a bubbling volcano in this game starring Rex and Trixie.
Green Army Men Shoot Camp - Toss baseballs to break plates at a green army men firing range.
Buzz Lightyear's Flying Tossers - Buzz Lightyear urges you to toss rings and make them land atop the Little Green Men.
Woody's Rootin' Tootin' Shootin' Gallery - Shoot suction-cup-tipped darts at a variety of mine-cart targets in this game inspired by the "Woody's Roundup" television show.
Compete with friends for the highest score or try to achieve a new personal best! But remember, whether you're an expert or a beginner, everyone's a winner!

Each guest's score is recorded by an onboard display screen as points are acquired with individual toy cannons firing simulated projectiles at virtual targets. Toy Story characters including Woody, Hamm, Buzz Lightyear, Rex and Trixie appear during the attraction's different games. Towards upon disembarking the ride, an individual vehicle has displays the high score up to date as far back as best to date this recent hour, day, and month.

Similar technology has been used in Disney attractions such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold at DisneyQuest and several Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin. According to Disney, it is the first attraction created simultaneously by Walt Disney Imagineering for two theme parks.[9]

Trivia
Woody, Jessie, Bo Peep, Bullseye and Mr. Potato Head appeared at the opening ceremony in May 31, 2008. Buzz Lightyear was unable to appear in person with them because he was spending a year in space.
Although Toy Story Mania is set after Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3, the wallpaper of Andy's room in Toy Story is seen in the ride. This was likely because the wallpaper was an iconic Pixar background.
In addition to toys, games, and books from the franchise, others referencing other Disney films, shorts, and places (both Pixar and non-Pixar) as well as large copies of other franchised games and toys decorate the entrance, queue and ride in addition to a few that can only be seen there. Some references include the classic Tinkertoy construction set packaging that Woody used for the meeting podium, a Tin Toy Little Golden Book, a K'Nex helicopter with box, View-Master reels (allegedly nearly four feet in diameter) for Peter Pan and Tomorrowland, Ants in the Pants, Play-Doh containers, UNO cards, Crayola crayons (plus chalk and markers in the new Toy Story Land location), and the gameboards and/or game boxes and cards for Monopoly and the 1952 version of Chutes and Ladders.
The Prospector is seen on the ride, despite the fact he is not part of Andy's toys or Bonnie's toys.
Bonnie's toys were added to the ride before the release of Toy Story 3. This may have revealed spoilers for the end of the film.
This carnival game has the same vehicle concept as the clone arcade game known as "Space Invaders Frenzy" with a large LED screen.

History of Toy Story Midway Mania
Development
The history of Toy Story Midway Mania began in 2005 with the beginning of the 50th Celebration event at Disneyland, where Imagineers Kevin Rafferty (Writer and Director) and Robert Coltrin (Concept Designer) were working on the Radiator Springs Racer attraction and during the the beginning of the 50th Celebration, Rafferty and Coltrin looked at the then-brand new Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters attraction.

Development
The history of Toy Story Midway Mania began in 2005 with the beginning of the 50th Celebration event at Disneyland, where Imagineers Kevin Rafferty (Writer and Director) and Robert Coltrin (Concept Designer) were working on the Radiator Springs Racer attraction and during the the beginning of the 50th Celebration, Rafferty and Coltrin looked at the then-brand new Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters attraction.  Both enjoyed the new attraction and agreed that something like Astro Blasters was needed for Disney's California Adventure as they were looking for something more to add to Radiator Springs attraction.  The idea for something interactive for Radiator Springs didn't pan out, but both Kevin and Robert liked the idea of an interactive attraction and kept working on developing the idea.  One day as they were walking around the Paradise Pier area of Disney's California Adventure, one of the midway games inspired the two to think of an idea for an attraction.

The basic premise was to create an attraction that was interactive and would allow guests to play a lot and so they tried to figure out how they could make this attraction idea interactive.  This brought the Imagineers back to an older attraction from DisneyQuest called Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold, where guests shot toy cannons at an interactive screen, simulating a ship battle on the sea. They liked the idea of being able to shoot virtual canon balls and sink ships and the ability to see the tracing of the canon ball shots got them thinking what if they took the idea but substituted something else for canon balls.  The shooting device from the Pirates attraction was an aspect that Imagineers decided to include in this new endeavour.  

The final piece in constructing this new idea for an attraction was to figure out what goes really good with games. Very quickly the characters from the Toy Story films by Pixar came to mind and very quickly development of the idea began. According to Robert Coltrin, they began developing the idea in August and by September they had shown Creative Management artwork for the new attraction so progress was very quick and Disney CEO Bob Iger liked the new idea and the project was green lit.  After showing Iger, Head of Pixar John Lasseter was shown the idea and he loved the new idea.  

The original idea for the attraction was "Traditional midway games that you can ride through, hosted by the Toy Story characters".  The attraction was comprised of a number of different midway games that featured Toy Story characters. In the original concept, there was a midway game where guests would shoot baseballs at various Mr. Potato Heads in a "knock over game".  Ultimately, this idea wasn't used as Mr. Potato Head didn't look happy in the artwork and also it wasn't a good idea to throw things at the characters.  A practice round was the first stop, where guests could get acclimated to the ride and then the ride would progress to the "Hamm and Eggs" scene, which was one of the first concepts that Robert and Kevin came up with and it stayed in the attraction from concept to completion.  The next scene was Bo Peep's Baaaa-loon Pop", which did make the final attraction, followed by "Sarge's Shoot out the Stars Green Army Men Camp", which did not make the final cut due to some technical difficulties.  The next scene was "Green Men Flying Tossers Game" and then "Slinky's Bone-Anza", where dog bones are shot out and Slinky, who is attached to a spring, tries to catch the bones guest shoot into bowls.  Another idea for a game was "Rex's Dino Dash", which was based on those games where players shoot water at a target to get their character to move across a map. In the game, players would shoot lava into their designated volcano, which would move their Rex player across the map in an effort to get Rex to safety before the meteor hits.  Another game was "Backyard Beachball Bash" where players launch beachlls into targets in a pool and this game gave rise to the idea of a 4D attraction where as you hit the water with your beach balls, water would splash at the player.  The final scene would be "Woody's Rootin' Tootin' Shooting Gallery", which would lead you to the score tally scene and after the ride you would find an animatronic Mr. Potato Head.

The good news was executives at Disney loved the idea and now Imagineers had to figure out how to actually implament the idea.  The first thing Imagineers did was go to the Los Angeles County Fair to actually play some of these midway games and see which games were still there and how they were run.  For the ride vehicle, the rides vehicles from the Monsters Inc ride in Tokyo was a project that Kevin and Robert had worked on and to them it made sense to use the basic premise of those rides in the new Toy Story attraction they were developing. Initial ideas had guests lined up in their vehicles and facing one direction, but there was a need to ensure that the capacity of the attraction could meet demand and eventually designed a new ride system to allow the vehicles to rotate fully and engage in different interactive screens, which was a departure from the Astro Blasters model where players moved in one direction at the same speed.  Inevitably, this lead Imagineers to design a ride vehicle that is the one we see in the attraction today.

The next question was where to place this new attraction.  The initial idea was to place it near the coaster in California Adventure, but Kevin suggested they place the attraction underneath the coaster so the two would be on top of each other.  Robert took the idea home and came back with an initial mockup for how it could be done, which involved removing some steel support beams, but the idea could work. The architect helped create a mockup for a turn of the century, sea side attraction that could be developed for Paradise Pier.  Meanwhile, Imagineers thought so much of the idea that they wanted to bring it to also the Disney-MGM Studios, which was an unique idea considering that cloning attractions was nothing new but developing the same attraction at two locations at once was something Disney had never done before.  Imagineers came up with an idea to place Pixar Studios inside the Disney's Hollywood Studios.  Luckily, the attraction would fit nearly perfectly into the vacant soundstage that was available for a new attraction.  Some designs were needed for the front facade and John Lasseter had the idea to make it look like the front of the Pixar Studios building and Imagineers went to the Pixar Animation Studios to get an idea of what to make.

The concept for the area surrounding the attraction was to have the Studio but still be rooted in fantasy, which was something John Lasseter was a proponent of.  So the story was to let the toys spill out into the street and ideas like the the Barrel of Monkeys and the Green Army Men that we see in the park today.

Development of the attraction continued and the idea was still that guests were at a carnival and the Toy Story characters would be operating their booths.  One day there was a breakthrough development because there was a story issue where in the film, when humans are around, the toys don't come to life so the idea was proposed to instead have the humans be shrunk down to the size of a toy and let guests come to the toy world.  The new storyline revolved around Andy getting a new midway playset for his birthday and while Andy was downstairs eating dinner, all the toys came to life to play with this new set. A decision was also made as to when in the time line of the Toy Story films this attraction should "exist".  Since the Toy Story 2 characters (Bullseye and Jessie) were wanted to be a part of the attraction, the ride takes places after the events of the first two Toy Story films.

Design
The design of Toy Story attraction was based around the toy that Andy has recieved for his birthday, the midway mania playset.  Imagineer Lori Coltrin (Senior Show Producer, Director) used the toy idea to develop the look for the trams, shooters, backdrops and other elements of the look of the attraction.  Lori event went as far as to design the Toy Story characters to look like they could have been sold seperately as an addon to the playset to match the set, as seen with Mr. Potato Head (although Mr. Potato Head was the only character to get such a makeover). Along the lines of the story line, Imagineers decided that the toys would pair up with their best friend and host their favorite game, while the guests play the games in the role of the other toys.  In terms of art direction, Imagineer Lori Coltrin chose to incorporate a lot of the elements from the first two Toy Story films, such as details from Andys room.  In addition, they incorporated toys that were of the same era as the toys featured in the film, so this included other toys popular in the 1960's and 1970's, which is also why we don't find more contemporary games in the attraction.  Imagineers also created some new artwork to help fill in the "gaps" of the various areas of the attraction. Imagineers designed some carnival or circus themed art, such as paint by numbers or pottery or puzzles to augment the existing art that came with the movie franchise.  

In Hollywood Studios, to get into the world of the toys from a design and story standpoint, the marquee at the entrance to the ride is made up of toys and as you pass under the marquee, you are instantly shrunken to the size of a toy.  The queue features an elaborate array of toys to completely envelop the guest as they wait in line, which features toys, art work and colors.  In the Hollywood Studios version of the attraction, the load and unload section has been designed to look like Andy's bedroom and incorporated a lot of the look of Andy's room from the films.  

The Game
A great deal of research and play testing was incorporated into the development of Toy Story Midway Mania.  Imagineer Sue Bryan (Senior Show Producer, Director) and her group were responsible for the creation of the game and to design the gameplay, Imagineers set up across the street from the main offices of the Imagineers an area for people of all ages, "from 2 to 92" to test out this new game.  Throughout the entire development of the ride, every 4-6 weeks, these testers were brought into play the game and provide feedback to Imagineers, which was then taken to improve the game.  One of the first challenges was getting a game that could work for players of all heights, so Imagineers went to a hardware store, where they purchased some random pieces of hardware to design a shooter for the ride. It still created a problem with the very short not being able to reach the shooter and the very tall being cramped in.  The solution was to attach the gun to the same mechanism that adjusted the height of the lap bar, so no matter how tall you were, the distance between the player and the gun, was uniform and comfortable.  

Another challenge was ensuring the games that were featured were easy enough for players to pick up, given that were barely a minute for each game so complex gameplay wasn't an option.  As an example, in the ring toss game, an early concept was to have a green alien involved a number of green aliens on platforms, but the aliens were quite small and a problem very quickly was it was difficult to actually get the rings to go around any of the targets, so subsequently, the targets were enlarged in size and added more targets and the second edition was created, although new problems came with it.  Since there were so many targets and rings could fire at a rate of 8 rings per second, very quickly the level would be swamped with rings and it became quite confusing.  Imagineers went back to the "drawing board" and came up with a third idea for the level, where there was multi-leveled targets with far fewer targets and if your ring didn't hit on a target on the first level, it would "fall" down to the next level where it might hit a target there. In addition, if you succesfully hit a target, the target would go down and the ring would go away, which solved another problem with an earlier model but then they had a new problem…the game was too easy. The next version had increased amount of targets but it proved to be too confusing in terms of where to shoot and the problem of too many rings bouncing around reared its ugly head once more. For the next version, Imagineers added some "magnetism" to the targets so when a ring got near the target, it would be attracted to the target and would assist the player.  This version was close, but not quite perfect and a few more refining went into the level and eventually, the ring toss game have in the attraction today is the version Imagineers decided upon.

The look of the games was another challenge.  Since the games aren't actually in any of the Toy Story films, someone had to invent how the game would look.  Even though the Toy Story films came out in the 1990's, in reality, Andy's bedroom and his toys are based on the toys of the 1960's and 1970's (which was the generation for the filmakers).  So Imagineers decided to make the game also look like a game, visually, from that era and one particular game was "Snoopy and the Red Baron" pop up game and they decided upon using cardboard flats with single colored plastic with some stickers and so each game in Toy Story Midway Mania, has that exact look.

Toy Story Midway Mania! is the first time that Walt Disney Imagineering is creating an attraction for two Disney Parks simultaneously.
It has been estimated that, each day, guests may break over one million virtual plates using the spring-action shooters.
Riders in the Sky, the award winning group that wrote the songs that Mr. Potato Head performs as part of the attraction, is the same group that wrote "Woody's Roundup" for the "Toy Story" feature films.
This is the first attraction that Walt Disney Imagineering designed where the Imagineers had to wear 3-D glasses to art direct all the black-light paint elements.
The murals located in the load area at Disney's Hollywood Studios are the biggest murals painted since Epcot was built.
In order to create a show that responds not only to every pull of a guest's spring-action shooter, but also every move their midway tram makes, there are over 150 computers communicating over multiple networks throughout the attraction.
At Toy Story Midway Mania! every guest gets to experience life at the size of a toy. So in Andy's room, a 5 foot 6 inch person will feel about 14" tall.
More time was spent programming Mr. Potato Head than for any other Audio-Animatronics figure ever created by Walt Disney Imagineering.
Mr. Potato Head will be able to say more lines of dialogue than any Audio-Animatronics figure ever created by Walt Disney Imagineering.
The Mr. Potato Head Audio-Animatronics figure is the first time that an Audio-Animatronics figure can remove a body part and re-attach it (in the case of his ear).
The Mr. Potato Head Audio-Animatronics figure has new, highly expressive and animated eyes that can look directly at a particular guest in the queue when speaking to him/her.
Mr. Potato Head marks the first Audio-Animatronics figure whose mouth appears to form words and vowel sounds.
US Patent Application for technology to be used on the ride

Toy Story Mania has secrets to getting a high score and below you will find the keys to revealing some targets worth a lot of points. Many of these strategies require cooperation between you and the person in the vehicle with you. Additionally, it helps if both of you have good practice at the attraction as some require good accuracy and quick speed.

To help differentiate between the single player and two-player strategies, we've used colors to distinguish between the two. Red indicates the strategy is for one player, while blue indicates it's best achieved with two players.

Current Toy Story Midway Mania Secrets
Hamm and Eggs

In the lower left or right corner (depending on the screen you are facing) is a hen house. Shoot the fox that is on top of the hen house (500 points) and then shoot the chickens that come out of the house very quickly (worth 1000 and 2000 points) and repeat this process the entire round.

Shoot the two pigs on the fence to reveal a cat and then shoot the cat. The cat pops up in the close to the barn. The point value for the cat goes to 500, 1000, 2000, 2000, 2000.

Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts

Break all 6 lava flow balloons and the volcano will spew balloons worth 500 points each

After you finish the lava flow trick (see above), there are two comets (one in the upper right and left corners) with a balloon on them. If you can pop the balloon three times, large comets of multiple balloons will come flying in from the side and "explode" in the middle of the screen.

Green Army Men Shoot Camp

A few seconds into the start of the round there will be two plates worth 2000 points that will shoot up into the air. If both you and your teammate hit both plates then a slew of other plates will appear with high point values will pop up.

Buzz Lightyear's Flying Tossers

If you hit all the aliens in the ship (8 aliens, worth 100 each) before even one can re-spawn, the ship launches to reveal a "monster" who opens his mouth and lets you rapid fire in your rings for 500 pts, then 1,000 pts a shot. Do this early so you can repeat the process again. Aim at 1,000 or 2,000 or the 5,000 point rocketships on the side during this quiet time, but come back to the monster when he's ready.

Woody's Rootin' Tootin' Shootin' Gallery

In the beginning of the round, there are a number of targets that when you shoot them spawn new targets. If you and your teammate can shoot each target once, then each target will disappear, and the screen will explode to reveal new bullseyes worth 1000 and 2000 points.

Shoot a plunger into the saloon doors. A bunny will pop out, and so will about 8 targets on top of the building. Four are worth 500, and the others are 1000.

In the mine carts scene, after the first three carts come by, hit the bat on top that appears for 1000 points. Then hit the mine carts again and then hit the new bat that is worth 5000. If you can hit that bat too, then all the mine carts that come out will be worth 5000 points.

In the finale of the game, there is a large target. Hit the target repeatedly as fast as you can for point values of 500, 1000 and 2000.

Stages that have been replaced from the current version of the attraction


Bo Peep's Baaa-loon Pop

There are two clouds located in the upper left and upper right corners of the screen with about 5 balloons to pop on them. Shoot four of the five balloons in each of the hovering clouds before popping the fifth and final balloons at the same time as your partner. If the last balloon on each cloud is popped at the same time (usually requires both players to coordinate), the falling balloons will be worth 2000 points each. There is about a second or two window to pop the last balloon on one cloud after the other cloud's last balloon is popped.

Shooting the low point flowers releases higher point bees.

Shoot the 500 point targets at the bottom and the 1000 point lamb in the middle of the screen. To make the balloons respawn, shoot one of the green or blue 100 point lambs.
