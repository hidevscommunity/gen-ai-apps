Mickey Mouse Park	1951-1955	A small park that would have been located right across the street from the Walt Disney Company headquarters in Burbank California. However, this plan was scrapped in favor of moving to Anaheim after Burbank's city council rejected the plans out of a desire to not have a carnival in the city, despite Walt's attempts to persuade them otherwise. While many of the ideas planned for the park would eventually be repurposed and realized as Disneyland. Others, such as a petting zoo, a duck boat ride and an Indian village, would be scrapped.	[

Walt Disney's Riverfront Square	1963-1965	An indoor theme park planned for St. Louis as Disney's second theme park.

Disney's America	1993-1994, 1997	A patriotic park to be located in Haymarket, Virginia. It was never built due to local opposition to the commercialization of American history and concern over the possibility it could damage Civil War battle sites, and a ride putting guests in the role of a runaway slave on the Underground Railroad.

Disney's Singapore	Late 1990s	A new indoor-theme park to be located in Singapore expected to have been the second in Asia after Japan's Tokyo Disney Resort, it reached the planning stages but failed to materialize owing to land acquisition issues and The Walt Disney Company having wished for the project to be primarily funded by the government. The Singaporean government responded that it was under its belief that a theme park should be run essentially by the private sector, not owned by the government. A few years later, Singapore was approached by Universal, who eventually built a Universal Studios in the country.	[

International Street	1955-1956	A land to be placed on the lagoon hosting the Submarine Voyage and the other boat ride attractions. Eventually became the idea for World Showcase at EPCOT.
Chinatown	1955	A side-street expansion to Main Street, U.S.A.
Edison Square	1955-1957	A land that would have been a side-street side-street expansion to Main Street U.S.A., themed around the addition of electricity in American homes. It would have featured a statue of Thomas Edison and a show about harnessing electricity.
Gay Nineties Square	Mid-1950s	An alternate take on Edison Square, but, this time, themed around a town in the 1890s.
Liberty Street	1956-1958	Another land that would have been a side-street expansion to Main Street U.S.A., themed around an American town circa 1776. It would have featured shops, The Hall of Presidents, Griffin's Wharf, the Liberty Tree, and recreations of famous American landmarks. This idea would later be brought to life in the Magic Kingdom as Liberty Square.
Dumbo's Circus Land	Early 1970s	A sub-area of Fantasyland where Dumbo the Flying Elephant & Casey Junior Circus Train would have been relocated. The idea eventually inspired the Storybook Circus sub-area of the Fantasyland expansion at the Magic Kingdom.
Big Town, U.S.A.	1976	An area where Mickey's Toontown now sits, themed around big cities like New York City and Chicago, which would have featured a big Broadway-style theater holding 3,000 guests with daily live shows, a restaurant similar to the Golden Horseshoe & a carnival fair with a ferris wheel, roller coaster and paddle boats. This idea became the inspiration for the American Waterfront at Tokyo DisneySea.
Discovery Bay	Late 1970s	A steampunk-style land that was to be a tribute to Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. Despite a model being showcased in the Preview Center for years and a pilot for a potential TV series based on the land's mythology being produced, the rise of science fiction over high adventure led to the land's eventual cancellation. Elements of the plans were later reused for Discoveryland at Disneyland Paris and Mysterious Island at Tokyo DisneySea, with one attraction in particular evolving into Journey into Imagination at Epcot.

Land of Legends	Late 1970s	An area based around American literature, folklore, and tall-tales planned for a spot north of Bear Country (now known as Critter Country) that would have connected it to Discovery Bay. Attractions included the famous Western River Expedition project as well as dark rides based on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and The Saga of Windwagon Smith with a Paul Bunyan restaurant.

LucasPort	1980s	In the 1980s, before Captain EO, Star Tours, & Indiana Jones Adventure, Disney Legend Tony Baxter, George Lucas, and a crew of Imagineers were re-imagining Tomorrowland that would place guests in a futuristic metropolis with environments inspired by Star Wars in a multi-level venue called LucasPort. If created, it would have revitalized Disneyland’s Tomorrowland. It was conceived as a brand-new area contained within a mixed-use glass superstructure that would include an interactive Star Wars-themed high-speed adventure, the original location for the ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter, shops and dining locations. The land would also have integrated existing attractions, like the Monorail and PeopleMover, into the new structure as part of Tomorrowland’s new towering skyline. Unfortunately, due to the scope and size of the project, LucasPort never made its way to Disneyland. Factors, such as the size of the Star Wars attraction building, and the cost of demolition and materials were deemed too expensive. In spite of LucasPort not being fully realized, one can appreciate the research and development that went into designing ambitious attractions never before seen at a Disney theme park.
Mickey's Starland	Early 1990s	An area where guests could meet Mickey Mouse & all of his pals. Even though, it wasn't built, a duplicate of this area would end up in the Magic Kingdom.
Tomorrowland 2055	1993-1994	An update and makeover of Tomorrowland with a more extraterrestrial theme, (2055 is the centennial of Disneyland). However, after Euro Disneyland failed, the project was abandoned due to budget cuts and replaced by the poorly-received Tomorrowland 1998 overhaul. The overhaul came so close to happening, that a full music loop was created and tested in the Space Mountain concourse (and is still playing), a mural was tested at the Tomorrowland Terrace (it, too, is still in place), and Imagineers working on the project received jackets with the Tomorrowland 2055 logo emblazoned on it.

Hollywoodland	Late 1990s	A land to be located between Main Street, U.S.A. and Tomorrowland. The side of Space Mountain facing the land would have been converted into the hill with the Hollywood letters on it. The land was themed after Hollywood's heyday from the 1930s & 1940s. It was designed to be a smaller copy of Hollywood Boulevard seen in Disney's Hollywood Studios. A similar concept was later used for the Disney California Adventure.

Israel Pavilion	Advertised on billboards when EPCOT opened, this would have recreated ancient Jerusalem with a courtyard stage and open-air restaurant. It remained unbuilt because of budget problems and security issues regarding the state of Israel, namely fears that the pavilion would turn EPCOT into a major target for terrorists.	"Jerusalem Post on Encyclopedia.com: Israel at Epcot".

Spain Pavilion	Also advertised on billboards circa 1986, this pavilion would have featured a boat ride similar to the Mexico Pavilion, with a design blending elements of Barcelona and Madrid. Also planned were a film on Spain's history and a restaurant.	"Jim Hill Media: Monday Mouse Watch".

Soviet Union Pavilion	During the projected "Phase II" expansion of EPCOT, a Russia-themed Pavilion was planned.

Venezuela Pavilion	This pavilion would have included a waterfall, a high-rise built into a cliff, and an aerial tram ride.
Equatorial Africa	During the opening day telecast, Danny Kaye and Alex Haley looked at a model of the future Equatorial Africa pavilion. The pavilion would have included the Sound Safari walkthrough, two film attractions, and the Heartbeat of Africa show. Despite the model being built and both films having actually been filmed, the pavilion was scrapped because South Africa was the only nation willing to back it, and Disney did not want to become associated with Apartheid. All that came of the pavilion was the African Outpost, which is still open today. The concept was eventually revived as the Africa section of Disney's Animal Kingdom.	[

Mickey's Movieland	Late 1980s	An area dedicated to the old-fashioned Mickey Mouse shorts and classic movie production with a replica of Disney's original Hyperion Avenue studio. Guests would encounter hands-on exhibits demonstrating classic movie production, such as creating Foley sound effects or spinning projectors to see classic Mickey drawings animated. Elements of this land were lent to The Magic of Disney Animation and the Monster Sound Show, which later evolved into Sounds Dangerous!.
Muppet Studios	1989-1991	A mini-land in the Streets of America area dedicated to the Muppets. Only Muppet*Vision 3D was completed before plans were put on-hold/cancelled after the death of Muppets creator Jim Henson in 1990. Was to feature another attraction, The Great Muppet Movie Ride, and two restaurants: The Swedish Chef's Video Cooking School and The Great Gonzo's Pandemonium Pizza Parlor. A similar land, titled "Muppets Courtyard" is currently at Hollywood Studios, using areas of the former Streets of America. Currently, the only show is Muppet*Vision 3D, there are no rides and the only two restaurants are Mama Melrose Ristorante Italiano and PizzeRizzo.
Roger Rabbit's Hollywood	1989-1992	An extension of Sunset Boulevard based on the 1988 film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. It would've featured a Red Car Trolley line running up the street, dropping guest off at a recreation of Maroon Studios, which would've been featured where Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith is located today. The land is known to have included three attractions: Toontown Trolley, Baby Herman's Runaway Baby Buggy, and Benny the Cab, and a recreation of the Terminal Bar. Disney and co-creator Steven Spielberg's company, Amblin, were in a legal dispute over the usage of the film/character, and future attractions not already in development were put on-hold. Some of the elements from this land, along with a proposed "Mickey's Starland" area became Mickey's Toontown.

Sci-Fi City	A whole new Tomorrowland designed by Eddie Sotto, DLP Main Street's show producer. It would have included "Cosmic Way" , the "Main Street" of science fiction with a theming inspired by anime, The Jetsons, Buck Rogers and the Rocketeer. Probably the best Tomorrowland theming ever done, and unfortunately never built for various reasons.
Mickeyville	At the end of 1990, Hani was asked by Walt Disney Imagineering to work on the creative development of a new project "Mickeyville" which was supposed to be a new land for Tokyo Disneyland. It was the first study for a "Toon Town", but much different than the one we know, as the architectural style was more "medieval". For a very good reason: this Mickeyville was supposed to be a tribute to Mickey's "medieval" cartoons, like "The Brave little tailor" or "Mickey and the Beanstalk". Hani's team was under the direction of Imagineers Yoshi Akiyama and Bob Weis (who designed the Disney-MGM Studios and Disney's America and who is now in charge of the huge placemaking of Disney's California Adventure). But, unfortunately, this medieval-styled land was cancelled forever. Eventually, Tokyo Disneyland created another version of Toontown which opened on April 15, 1996.

Atlantis Expedition	A re-theming of the Submarine Voyage in Tomorrowland at Disneyland, in which guests would have been able to use a mechanical arm that extended out into the water from their submarine window to grab at gold coins & gems lining the sea floor. The box-office failure of the 2001 animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire caused this planned revamp to be scrapped.

Rock Candy Mountain	An addition to the Casey Jr. Train Ride in Fantasyland, it was supposed to be a mountain, that looked like it was made out of rock candy (and other various types of candy, such as licorice, lollipops, and candy canes), with a glossy, translucent appearance. The planned Rainbow Road To Oz attraction, was supposed to go underneath the mountain, and the ride would be inside it. It was cancelled due to Walt Disney being concerned about how they would be able to maintain and clean the mountain "because of all the smog" that came from around Anaheim. One rumor states that Imagineers and birds actually picked the model to pieces, and another states Walt axed it because of its "sickly appearance". A rock candy mountain model very similar to the original concept can be found in the window of Trolley Treats at Disney California Adventure.	[

Fireworks Factory	An interactive shooter ride designed for Discovery Bay, housed inside a fireworks factory, where guests would shoot at skyrockets, pinwheels, and other fireworks. A much smaller version was placed in Mickey's Toontown, though this version is merely an interactive gag in the land and not a ride.	"Discovery Bay". The Neverland Files.

The Enchanted Snow Palace	A dark ride that was planned for Fantasyland at Disneyland. Marc Davis was instrumental in its design, and it was the final ride he designed. It was designed as a boat ride on a river of melting ice, past naturalistic scenes of Arctic wildlife, beneath a display of the Northern Lights, and into the realm of the Snow Queen, a fantastical land populated by frost fairies and snow giants. Although the board really liked the idea, guests were demanding more roller coasters, and nearby Valencia-based Magic Mountain had plenty; the board reluctantly rejected the ride in favor of Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Extensive concept art still exists for this attraction. However, this attraction became the inspiration for Frozen Ever After.	Shaun Finnie (2006). The Disneylands That Never Were, page 72–73.

Guests would have hopped into coffin sleds (similar to Peter Pan's Flight) and glide through scenes from the movie. This idea became the inspiration for Haunted Mansion Holiday.
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride roller coaster	Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was originally envisioned as a roller coaster. Walt Disney decided to change it to a dark ride because he felt the roller coaster concept would've alienated young children and the elderly.
Rogues Gallery	A basement walk-through wax museum beneath New Orleans Square in which Disneyland guests would have seen wax figure scenes recreating pirate history. Basement for it was dug. Was put on hold so Walt Disney and his Imagineers could work on attractions for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Concept eventually evolved into the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.
Pirate Wax Museum	Another version of Rogues Gallery. Would have featured famous pirates narrating wax-made scenes. Became Pirates of the Caribbean, when Walt changed the ride system from walkthrough to boat ride.
The Saga of Windwagon Smith	A dark ride based on the cartoon short of the same name which planned for Land of Legends.
Plectu's Fantastic Intergalactic Revue	An attraction that was supposed to be located where America Sings once resided. It would have been an outer-space musical-variety revue featuring a troupe of Audio-Animatronics itinerant alien musicians whose spaceship has landed in Tomorrowland. However, the idea, which was part of the original 'Tomorrowland 2055' plan, eventually was scrapped due to budget constraints. The space that would have been Plectu's Fantastic Intergalactic Revue is now home to Tomorrowland Expo Center.
The UFO Show	Armed with air guns, guests would have boarded cars and tried to shoot "eerie, un-human, gremlin-like targets". Would have been staged upstairs over America Sings. Eventually became the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters.
Nostromo	A hi-tech interactive attraction based on Ridley Scott's Alien in which visitors would have rolled through the darkened corridors of the Nostromo. Riding inside of heavily armored vehicles. Armed with laser cannons, guests would have been sent on rescue mission to find the missing members of Nostromo's crew as well as rid the spaceship of all alien intruders.
Young Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular	An elaborate stunt was to have been produced in collaboration with George Lucas. This action-packed live extravaganza would have thrust Young Indy into a series of thrilling adventures and misadventures, adding a new dimension to the legendary lore of one of Hollywood's greatest heroes." Part of the show would have involved Young Indy running along the top of a passing Disneyland Railroad train. The famous ghost hearse outside of The Haunted Mansion was purchased for the show, until plans were scrapped.
Casey Junior Circus Train roller coaster	The Casey Junior Circus Train was initially envisioned as a full-fledged roller coaster—the first in the park—before initial test runs proved that such a ride would be too cost-prohibitive to run. It was thus reduced in speed and kept as a slow-moving ride. However, Disneyland Paris did eventually get a Casey Junior themed roller-coaster.
The Island at the Top of the World	A zeppelin ride to a lost civilization in the Arctic designed for Discovery Bay.
Professor Marvel's Gallery of Illusion	A gallery of illusions hosted by Professor Marvel & his little dragon friend. For Discovery Bay. The concept evolved into Journey Into Imagination.

Guests would enter Lafitte's crypt in a graveyard across from the Haunted Mansion and travel through a catacomb themed tunnel under the river to the island, which would also feature shipwrecks and Lafitte's treasure vault. Would partially inspire the Pirate's Lair retool.
Western River Expedition	A clone of the planned attraction for Magic Kingdom that would have been placed in Land of Legends.
Here Come the Muppets	A clone of the show at Disney's Hollywood Studios which would have been performed in the Videopolis theater.

The Little Mermaid ride	A suspended dark ride based on the 1989 animated film The Little Mermaid. Similar to Peter Pan's Flight, guests would have boarded a clam shell and journeyed under the sea featuring multiple scenes from the movie with a much more grander finale, a whirlpool, and a giant Ursula. Ultimately became both The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure at Disney California Adventure in 2011 & Under the Sea: Journey of the Little Mermaid in 2012.
ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter	A theater-in-the-round attraction that was to be installed in the space that housed Mission to Mars. This attraction was planned for both LucasPort & Tomorrowland 2055. However, "Tomorrowland 2055" would be drastically scaled back and the Mission to Mars space would end up housing Redd Rockett's Pizza Port. The concept would end up moving to the Magic Kingdom for its debut.
The Mystery Shack	For one concept that didn't even get past the initial pitch, former Imagineer Brandon Kleyla created the idea of bringing The Mystery Shack from Gravity Falls to the former Big Thunder Ranch. The executives were baffled and quickly shut it down.

The final version of the ride, renamed Superstar Limo was hated by both park guests and Imagineers, ultimately leading to its closure less than a year after it opened.

Western River Expedition	A Pirates of the Caribbean-style ride through the Wild West. This was first proposed for Walt Disney's Riverfront Square.

When the Princess Fairytale Hall, was planned, the concepts for the cottages where scrapped, and incorporated into the attraction.	"New Fantasy Land".

Matterhorn Bobsleds	During construction of the Magic Kingdom, land between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland was set aside with the intention to build a clone of the Matterhorn Bobsleds. This version would have had the Walt Disney World Railroad pass through it, rather than the Skyway. The land earmarked for the mountain will now be used for the TRON Lightcycle Power Run roller coaster.

Simulated bullet train ride	A unique variation on Disney's CircleVision 360 show. Guests would have found themselves standing aboard a vibrating recreation of the passenger compartment of a Japanese bullet train. Looking out through the oversized faux windows in this passenger car, they would have been treated to a high-speed travelogue as some of Japan's most beautiful scenery whizzed by the windows. One version of the attraction involved an encounter with famed Japanese movie monster, Godzilla, which was likely scrapped as the Godzilla series was in a hiatus after Terror of MechaGodzilla bombed at the Japanese box office in 1975. The attraction was planned for the Japan Pavilion at Epcot.
Rhine River Cruise	A cruise down Germany's most famous rivers, including the Rhine, the Tauber, the Ruhr, and the Isar. Detailed miniatures of famous landmarks would also be seen, including one of the Cologne Cathedral. The ride entrance and part of the building that would have housed it are still visible at the Germany pavilion.

Meet the World	A clone of the Tokyo Disneyland attraction was planned for the Japan Pavilion, and was so close to completion, the entire show building was constructed, until it was discovered that a miscalculation in construction caused the rotating mechanism to put too much stress on the support beams. Since this would require a complete rework, and construction of the park as a whole already being behind schedule (not to mention the show glossing over World War II, which raised fears in management that American and Japanese veterans of the war would raise a stink), it was decided to move ahead without the attraction, which ran at Tokyo Disneyland from 1983 to 2002. The show's English soundtrack can be found on YouTube. The building itself still stands and is used for rehearsals and storage.
Mt. Fuji roller coaster	A roller coaster modeled after the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland. Planned for the Japan Pavilion at Epcot. It was rejected after protests by Eastman Kodak, sponsor of Journey Into Imagination over a ride sharing the name of their biggest competitor, Fujifilm.

The American Adventure	Imagineer Marc Davis worked on a number of concepts for this attraction. From a 1975 proposal for a dark ride that was a whimsical and musical exploration of American history and culture to more serious explorations of American folkore and historical figures during 1976. Concepts during this period grouping different figures from across American history together based on shared identities, with a piece based on American humorists putting Mark Twain, Benjamin Franklin, and Will Rogers together inspiring the final show, though Davis would leave the project shortly afterwards. Continuing the idea of an animatronic stage show, Imagineering would find a way to distill the history of the United States into a half-hour show. The show's hosts, Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain, representing the 1700s and 1800s, were initially to have been joined by Will Rogers as a representative of the 20th century, but the creative team was worried that Will Rogers wasn't quite as iconic a figure to represent the modern era that could stand next to the other two hosts, reducing Rogers to a smaller role in the Great Depression scene. The show opened with the park on October 1, 1982, and beyond a technical upgrade in 1993 and occasional updates to the Golden Dream montage film, has remained mostly unchanged.

Creatures' Choice Awards	A comedic animatronic show taking the form of an Awards Show for classic movie monsters, hosted by Eddie Murphy (as "Eddie FrankenMurphy") and featuring Elvira, Mistress of the Dark as one of the presenters. The main subplot of the show would follow Godzilla, the guest of honor and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award, on his journey from Japan to Walt Disney World, which would regularly be shown on the main screen before literally bringing down the house in the finale.
Rock 'n' Roller Coaster starring The Rolling Stones	Disney initially sought out The Rolling Stones to be the band featured in Rock 'n' Roller Coaster, but while the band was enthusiastic about the idea, their asking price was too high for Disney's liking.
The Great Movie Ride	Originally, much more of The Great Movie Ride would have been based around The Wizard of Oz — riders would be "swept away" by the tornado to Munchkinland, and the final room would be the Wizard's chamber, in which he introduced the closing Montage of great film moments. Because Ted Turner (the movie's rights-holder) stipulated that only so much time could be given over to Oz scenes, the tornado was replaced by a Fantasia segment, and the final room became nondescript.
Rock 'n' Roller Coaster starring KISS	Another attempt at the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster attraction but with the heavy metal rock band KISS.
