The Tokyo Disney Resort (東京ディズニーリゾート, Tōkyō Dizunī Rizōto) (local nickname TDR[1]) is a theme park and vacation resort located in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan, just east of Tokyo. The resort is fully owned and operated by The Oriental Land Company (a subsidiary of the Keisei Electric Railway Company) under a licence from The Walt Disney Company, who constructed and designed the resort and its various attractions.

The resort opened on April 15, 1983, as a single theme park (Tokyo Disneyland), later developing into a resort with a second theme park (Tokyo DisneySea), five Disney hotels, six non-Disney hotels and a shopping complex (Ikspiari). Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park to open outside the United States and the resort is the only Disney Parks resort in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.

Map of the Tokyo Disney Resort
Tokyo Disney Resort consists of Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea, and Ikspiari, which is a variation of the Downtown Disney and Disney Springs shopping, dining, and entertainment areas found at the Disney resorts in Anaheim and Lake Buena Vista respectively. It also contains Bon Voyage!, a large Disney goods specialty shop.

Like other Disney resorts, the Tokyo Disney Resort includes several Disney-branded hotels; the resort's three "Deluxe" Hotels are the Disney Ambassador Hotel, the Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta and the Tokyo Disneyland Hotel. The Resort also includes the "Moderate" type Tokyo Disney Resort Toy Story Hotel and the "Value" type Tokyo Disney Resort Celebration Hotel. There are six other hotels located on the Tokyo Disney Resort property. These, however, are not Disney-branded hotels and are owned by other companies, similar to the Hotel Plaza Boulevard hotels at Walt Disney World.

All facilities are linked by the Disney Resort Line monorail, with the exception of the Celebration Hotel which is connected to the resort area via a free 15-minute shuttle. The Tokyo Disney Resort is headed by Toshio Kagami, who is the representative director (CEO) of the Oriental Land Company.
