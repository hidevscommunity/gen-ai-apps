===WED Enterprises===
Walt Disney, Inc. (WDI) was formed by [[Walt Disney]] on December 16, 1952 with an engineering division tasked with designing [[Disneyland]].<ref name=hr>{{cite book|last1=Aberdeen|first1=J.

===Imagineering===
The unit was renamed as of January 1986 to Walt Disney Imagineering. In 1996, [[Disney Development Company]], the Disney conglomerate's real estate development subsidiary, merged into Imagineering.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walt Disney Imagineering |url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/walt-disney-imagineering/ |website=D23: Disney A to Z |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |access-date=November 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906044911/https://d23.com/a-to-z/walt-disney-imagineering/ |archive-date=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Imagineering created [[Disney Theatrical Group#Background|Disney Fair]], a U.S. traveling attraction, which premiered in September 1996. With poor attendance, the fair was pulled after a few stops. Disney Entertainment Projects (Asia Pacific), Inc., a new Disney Asian Pacific subsidiary, selected a renamed fair called DisneyFest as its first project taking it to Singapore to open there on October 30, 1997.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matzer |first1=Marla |title=It Didn't Play in Puyallup, so Disney Tries Singapore |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/28/business/fi-26586 |access-date=September 23, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 28, 1997 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923090252/http://articles.latimes.com/1997/aug/28/business/fi-26586 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

By 1997, Imagineers were in several buildings in Grand Central Business Park when Disney purchased the park. In September 1999, Disney Imagineering announced the Grand Central Creative Campus redesign of the industrial park with a new office-studio complex anchored by Disney Imagineering. Some of the buildings were demolished to make way for new buildings. The additional space would be for sound stages, production facilities and offices.<ref name=lat0>{{cite news|last1=Blankstein|first1=Andrew|title=Disney Reveals Plans for $2-Billion Glendale Project|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/14/local/me-8721|access-date=October 7, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 14, 2000|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009180435/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/14/local/me-8721|archive-date=October 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Blankstein|first1=Andrew|title=New Disney Campus in Glendale to Hire 10,000|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/14/local/me-8637|access-date=October 7, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 14, 2000|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518065002/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/14/local/me-8637|archive-date=May 18, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

As part of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s March 2018 strategic reorganization, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts merged with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media segments into [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products]] (DPEP), giving Disney Imagineering oversight of merchandise, games and publishing development.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Christine|title=Disney announces strategic reorganization, effective immediately|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/disney-announces-strategic-reorganization-effective-immediately.html|access-date=March 14, 2018|work=CNBC|date=March 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://dpep.disney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fact_sheet_walt_disney_imagineering_2019_Q4.pdf Fact Sheet Walt Disney Imagineering 2019 Q4]</ref>

In July 2021, DPEP chairman [[Josh D'Amaro]] announced that approximately 2,000 DPEP positions would be transferred over the next couple of years to the [[Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida|Lake Nona]] area of [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name="MacDonald">{{cite news |last1=MacDonald |first1=Brady |title=Disney Imagineering relocation shifts creative balance of power from California to Florida |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2021/10/29/disney-imagineering-relocation-shifts-creative-balance-of-power-from-california-to-florida/ |access-date=3 January 2022 |work=Orange County Register |date=October 29, 2021}}</ref>  In November 2021, it was reported that as many as 90% of the positions to be transferred are Walt Disney Imagineering positions, as DPEP relocates Imagineering's headquarters from Glendale to a new 60-acre corporate campus in Lake Nona.<ref name="Rice">{{cite news |last1=Rice |first1=Katie |title=Disney's Lake Nona campus means big gains for company but likely staff losses, too |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-lake-nona-relocation-update-20211102-kslfkec4ivhkfcgel6nsvcigci-story.html |access-date=3 January 2022 |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=November 7, 2021}}</ref>  The only Imagineering positions reportedly exempt from relocation were those dedicated to Disneyland or certain international parks.<ref name="MacDonald" /> The relocation was reportedly motivated in part by $570 million in [[tax incentive|tax breaks]] from the state of Florida, as well as Florida's business-friendly climate, lower [[cost of living]], and lack of a [[state income tax]].<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Rice" /> This relocation was cancelled in May 2023 amidst [[Disney v.

New concepts and improvements are often created to fulfill specific needs. For instance, the [[Soarin' Over California]] ride system was designed to help guests experience the sensation of flight. During development, Imagineer Mark Sumner found an [[Erector Set|erector set]] in his attic, which quickly inspired the solution to create this experience. The ride effectively simulates [[hang gliding]].<ref name=Disneyland>{{Cite video |people=George Scribner and Jerry Rees (Directors) |title=Disneyland: Secrets, Stories, and Magic |medium=DVD |publisher=Walt Disney Video |date=2007}}

WDI partnered with the [[Khan Academy]] to create a series of online video classes called [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/hass-storytelling/imagineering-in-a-box Imagineering in a Box], to allow students to "explore different aspects of theme park design, from characters to ride development..." The classes, which are organized into three main categories (''Creating Worlds'', ''Designing Attractions'', and ''Bringing Characters to Life''), are presented by WDI employees using multimedia lessons and exercises.

===The Imagineering Pyramid===
Past Disney Imagineers have shared 15 principles of Disney Imagineering, divided into five tiers. These are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://imagineeringtoolbox.wordpress.com/resources/the-imagineering-pyramid-an-overview/|title=The Imagineering Pyramid – An Overview|date=2016-05-25|website=The Imagineering Toolbox|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The imagineering pyramid : using Disney theme park design principles to develop and promote your creative ideas|last=J.|first=Prosperi, Louis|others=Imagineers (Group)|isbn=9781941500965|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=956510763|date = April 14, 2016}}</ref>

* It All Begins with a Story
* Creative Intent
* Attention to Detail
* Theming
* Long, Medium, and Close Shots
* Wienies
* Transitions
* [[Storyboards]]
* Pre-Shows and Post-Shows
* [[Forced Perspective]]
* "Read"-ability
* Kinetics
* The "[[It's a Small World]]" Effect
* [[Hidden Mickeys]]
* Plussing

[[Walt Disney]] coined the term "plussing" for the process of constantly striving to perfect Imagineering work. Disney believed that there is always room for innovation and improvement, stating "Disneyland will never be completed as long as there's imagination left in the world".<ref name="Disneyland" /> This sometimes takes the form of returning to previously abandoned ideas, such as the rework of the Museum of the Weird wax museum concept into the present [[The Haunted Mansion]].<ref name=Disneyland/>

===The Art of the Show===
Disney theme parks are storytelling and visual experiences, also known as “The Art of the Show.” The use of theming, atmosphere, and attention to detail are essential in the Disney experience. Creative director [[John Hench]] noted the similarities between theme park design and film making, such as the use of techniques including [[forced perspective]].<ref name="Hench">{{Cite book|title=Designing Disney: Imagineering and the Art of the Show|last=Hench|first=John|author2=Peggy Van Pelt|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2003|location=New York}}
</ref> One notable example of forced perspective is [[Cinderella Castle]] in [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World]]. The scale of architectural elements is much smaller in the upper reaches of the castle compared to the foundation, making it seem significantly taller than its actual height of 189 feet.<ref name="Wright" /><ref name="themeparktourist.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20140922/29295/8-principles-disney-imagineer|title=8 Key Principles That Disney Imagineers Use to Develop New Attractions|date=2014-09-22|website=Theme Park Tourist|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>

The attraction, [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], evokes a “rollicking buccaneer adventure,” according to Hench. In contrast, the [[Disney Cruise Line]] ships create an elegant seafaring atmosphere. Minor details in theme park shops and restaurants are crucial; these include the menus, names of the dishes and the [[Cast Members]]’ costumes.<ref name="Hench" /> When guests walk down the area of [[Main Street, U.S.A.]], they are likely to notice a bakery fragrance,<ref name="themeparktourist.com"/> reminiscent of [[Middle America (United States)|suburban America]] in the 1900s. In addition to theme parks, Imagineering has devised retail stores, galleries, and hotels which have "stories" and create a specific mood. For instance, the [[Disney's Contemporary Resort]] features an [[A-frame]] structure, modern décor and futuristic features including a quiet [[monorail]] in the lobby. These details reinforce the hotel's contemporary nature.<ref name="Marling" />

In 2010, Disney Educational Products produced a series of videos called ''The Science of Disney Imagineering''. Each video was presented by Imagineer Asa Kalama and focused on a different science subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dep.disney.go.com/page_meet-asa-kalama.html|title=Meet Asa Kalama|website=disney.com|publisher=Disney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403105624/http://dep.disney.go.com/page_meet-asa-kalama.html|archive-date=April 3, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=January 26, 2015}}</ref> Each video featured at least one Disney attraction, to show how science was used in them. These science subjects include [[Gravity]], [[Trajectory]], [[Levers]] & [[Pulleys]], [[Fluids]], [[Energy]], [[Design]] & [[Physical model|Models]], [[Magnetism]], [[Motion (physics)|Motion]], [[Animal communication|Animal Adaptations: Communication]], [[Friction]], and [[Electricity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dep-store.com/product-p/77e29vl00.htm|title=The Science of Disney Imagineering: Buy All 11 DVDs|website=dep-store.com|publisher=Disney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126193922/http://www.dep-store.com/product-p/77e29vl00.htm|archive-date=January 26, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=January 26, 2015}}</ref>

===Mickey's Ten Commandments===
In 1991, [[Marty Sklar]] (then-president of Imagineering) presented ten commandments attributed to Mickey Steinberg (the vice president of Imagineering). They are:<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/buzzprice/161/ |title=The Way We Do Business |conference=Walt Disney Imagineering Workshop 1991 |date=April 25–26, 1991 |publisher=Walt Disney Imagineering, The Disney Development Company |access-date=September 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921074745/http://stars.library.ucf.edu/buzzprice/161/ |archive-date=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

# Know your audience
# Wear your guest's shoes (don't forget the human factors; try to experience the parks from the guests' point of view)
# Organize the flow of people and ideas (ensure experiences tell a story that is organized and logically laid out)
# Create a "Wienie" (Walt Disney's term for a "visual magnet")
# Communicate with visual literacy (use a dominant color or shape or building to reinforce a theme)
# Avoid overload—create turn-ons (do not offer too much detailed information)
# Tell one story at a time (put one 'big idea' in each show so guests leave with a clear understanding of the theme)
# Avoid contradictions—maintain identity (avoid irrelevant or contradicting elements; make sure the audience has a clear idea of what is being said)
# For every ounce of treatment, provide a ton of treat (take advantage of the distinction of the theme park, which is that it encourages active participation, compared to passive entertainment)
# Keep it up (do not become complacent or allow things to run down)

==Innovation==
[[File:Disney and pirate heads (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] in 1966, inspecting plastic heads for use in the Disneyland iteration of [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]]]
Imagineering has been granted over 300 patents<ref>{{cite press release |title=Disney Blends Imagination and Technology to Deliver Landmarks in Theme Park Innovation |url=https://wdwnews.com/releases/disney-blends-imagination-and-technology-to-deliver-landmarks-in-theme-park-innovation/ |publisher=Walt Disney World |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> in areas such as advanced audio systems, [[fiber optics]], interactive technology, live entertainment, ride systems and special effects.<ref name="lat0" /> Imagineering pioneered technological advances such as the [[Circle-Vision 360°]] film technique and the [[FastPass]] virtual queuing system.

===Audio-Animatronics===
{{main|Audio-Animatronics}}
Imagineering is known for its development of Audio-Animatronics, a form of robotics, used in shows and theme park attractions that animate objects in [[3D film|three dimension (3D)]]. The idea originated from Walt Disney's fascination with a mechanical bird that he purchased in [[New Orleans]], which later led to the development of the attraction, [[The Enchanted Tiki Room]]. The attraction, which featured singing Audio-Animatronic birds, was the first to use this technology. In the [[1964 World's Fair]], a 3D figure of [[Abraham Lincoln]] was represented. The animated Lincoln delivered part of the [[Gettysburg Address]] for the "[[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]]" exhibit, the first human Audio-Animatronic figure.<ref name="WDISite">{{cite web |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/careers/who_imagineering.html |title=The Walt Disney Company Home&nbsp;— Jobs and Careers |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102031939/http://corporate.disney.go.com/careers/who_imagineering.html |archive-date=November 2, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Today, Audio-Animatronics are featured in many attractions, including [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], [[The Haunted Mansion]], [[The Hall of Presidents]], [[Country Bear Jamboree]], [[Star Tours—The Adventures Continue]], and [[Muppet*Vision 3D]]. Guests have also had the opportunity to interact with Audio-Animatronic characters, such as [[Lucky the Dinosaur]], [[WALL·E (character)|WALL·E]], and Remy from ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. The next wave of Audio-Animatronic development focuses on completely independent figures, also known as "[[Autonomatronics]]". Otto, the first Autonomatronic figure, debuted at the 2009 [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] and can see, hear, sense a person's presence and emotions, and have a conversation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2009/09/disney-autonomatronics-figure-can-sense-if-youre-happy/ |title=Disney Autonomatronics Figure Can Sense If You're Happy |work=Disney Parks Blog |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111193259/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2009/09/disney-autonomatronics-figure-can-sense-if-youre-happy/ |archive-date=November 11, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===WEDway===
[[WEDway]] is a [[people mover]] system using [[linear motor|linear induction motor]] (LIM) technology to propel vehicles along a pair of steel rails. This system was developed in the company's early years. The system is in operation at [[Walt Disney World Resort]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]. From 1967 to 1995, [[Disneyland]] utilized a version of this system which had rubber wheels placed every 9 feet along the guide-way.

==Theme park projects==

==Other projects==
Former creative director [[John Hench]] designed the "Tower of Nations" for the opening and closing ceremony of the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], whilst Walt Disney served as Pageantry Committee chairman.

Imagineering has collaborated with [[Disney Consumer Products]] on a number of projects for [[Disney Store]]s. The first store, in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], was designed and constructed by a group of architectural Imagineers. Imagineering developed the now-defunct Walt Disney Gallery at the Main Place Mall in [[Santa Ana, California]], and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] themed Disney Store at [[The Forum Shops at Caesars]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. After the purchase of the Disney Stores by [[The Children's Place]] in 2004, Imagineering helped design an exclusive chain of flagship stores, called [[World of Disney]]. These are located in resorts, [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]] and [[Anaheim, California]], as well as New York City. Another flagship store arrived at [[Disneyland Paris]] in 2012. An overhaul of [[Disney Store]]s was planned in 2009 with the help of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]]. Disney hoped to transition from a traditional [[retail]] model to an [[Interactive media|interactive]] entertainment hub.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/business/media/13disney.html?_r=1|title=Disney's Retail Plan Is a Theme Park in Its Stores|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=October 13, 2009|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=October 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129225625/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/business/media/13disney.html?_r=1|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}

In the 1990s, Imagineering designed the {{convert|24000|sqft}} [[Club Disney]] interactive family fun center in [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. Although now closed, it was the first of several location-based entertainment (LBE) venues. In 1998, [[DisneyQuest]], an {{convert|80000|sqft}} high-tech, virtual reality arcade was launched at [[Disney Springs]] in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]. Another DisneyQuest in [[Chicago]] was launched a year later. In 2007, Imagineering oversaw design and construction of ships, [[Disney Dream]] and [[Disney Fantasy]]. They also helped design exhibitions for the [[Autry National Center|Autry Museum of Western Heritage]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and developed the Encounter Restaurant, which is located at the top of [[Theme Building]] in [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. Moreover, they provided exhibits for the [[Port Discovery (museum)|Port Discovery]] children's museum at the [[Inner Harbor]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], as well as the "Below Deck" sound show depicting [[Blackbeard]]'s final battle as part of the Pirate and Treasure Museum in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].

From 1995 to 1997, Imagineering oversaw the renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] in New York City.<ref name="Free Online Library 2015">{{cite web | title=New Amsterdam Theatre |via=Free Online Library | last=Patterson|first= Maureen |work=Buildings |date=Apr 1, 1998 | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+Amsterdam+Theatre-a020633601 | access-date=2022-01-19}}</ref> Imagineering also remodeled the [[Times Square Studios]] in [[New York City]] in 1996, following the acquisition of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In 1997, Disney purchased the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] and renamed the team to Anaheim Angels. Shortly, Imagineering renovated the [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim Stadium]]. Recently, Imagineering worked with charity, [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)]], to create the teaser video and the story, as well as the theming of the 2016 [[FIRST Robotics Competition]], [[FIRST Stronghold]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Merrick |first1=Frank |title=The Teaser is Coming! |url=http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/blog-The-Teaser-Is-Coming |website=usfirst.org |publisher=US FIRST |access-date=October 15, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015174430/http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/blog-The-Teaser-Is-Coming |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|year=2016|title=2016 FIRST Robotics Competition Kickoff Broadcast|language=en|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lBiwIt2Xh8|access-date=January 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202105152/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lBiwIt2Xh8|archive-date=February 2, 2016|time=28:50|publisher=[[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology]]|quote=Of course, we had tremendous help in doing all of this from our friends at Walt Disney Imagineering.
