Our purpose and values
Our purpose is to provide quality, affordable hotels for our guests to help them to live and work well, and to positively impact the world around us.

A brief history of Whitbread
Whitbread is one of the UK’s oldest companies, with a history going all the way back to 1742. For the first 250 years, it was our breweries and pubs we were famous for, but in 2001 we refocused on hotels and restaurants to become the hospitality business we are today.

Force for Good
We believe we have a responsibility to help people live and work well. Our sustainability programme, ‘Force for Good’, aims to ensure we have a positive impact on all of our stakeholders and the world around us. Split into three pillars; opportunity, community and responsibility, we’ve made great progress so far and have set long-term strategic targets to continue on our journey.
