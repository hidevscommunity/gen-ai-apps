Summary
Hello, thank you for visiting my LinkedIn. My name is Sammy Sloan.
I currently work at MS as Analytical Lead, leading MS Search
Engine analytics. Prior to MS, I was a Data Scientist at Amazon
where I received awards for my work as a data science leader
driving large-scale experimentations and data science initiatives. My
story of resilience was featured on Forbes (see Featured section to
read the article).
Prior to joining Amazon and MS, I attended University of
Washington and graduated as the class valedictorian, delivering a
graduation speech to an audience of over 3,000. This is absolutely a
highlight of my educational journey.
As the first-female in my family to graduate university, I am an
advocate of women's education and workforce diversity, and actively
participate in diversity, equity & inclusion within and outside of
MS. I enjoy public speaking and have spoken at +50 talks to an
audience of over 10,000.
In my free time, I enjoy creating educational content on various
platforms on data science, career and financial literacy. One of my
2019 goals is to help ABC in tech negotiate job offer by $2M and I
completed that goal with $1.3M negotiated in 2021.
