Valid Word Square,Easy,"Given an array of strings `words`, return `true` _if it forms a valid **word square**_.

A sequence of strings forms a valid **word square** if the `kth` row and column read the same string, where `0 <= k < max(numRows, numColumns)`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""abcd "", ""bnrt "", ""crmy "", ""dtye ""\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
The 1st row and 1st column both read  ""abcd "".
The 2nd row and 2nd column both read  ""bnrt "".
The 3rd row and 3rd column both read  ""crmy "".
The 4th row and 4th column both read  ""dtye "".
Therefore, it is a valid word square.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""abcd "", ""bnrt "", ""crm "", ""dt ""\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
The 1st row and 1st column both read  ""abcd "".
The 2nd row and 2nd column both read  ""bnrt "".
The 3rd row and 3rd column both read  ""crm "".
The 4th row and 4th column both read  ""dt "".
Therefore, it is a valid word square.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""ball "", ""area "", ""read "", ""lady ""\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**
The 3rd row reads  ""read "" while the 3rd column reads  ""lead "".
Therefore, it is NOT a valid word square.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 500`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 500`
*   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.","```python
def valid_word_square(words):
    for i in range(len(words)):
        for j in range(len(words[i])):
            if j >= len(words) or i >= len(words[j]) or words[i][j] != words[j][i]:
                return False
    return True

Reshape the Matrix,Easy,"In MATLAB, there is a handy function called `reshape` which can reshape an `m x n` matrix into a new one with a different size `r x c` keeping its original data.

You are given an `m x n` matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c` representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the `reshape` operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = \[\[1,2\],\[3,4\]\], r = 1, c = 4
**Output:** \[\[1,2,3,4\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = \[\[1,2\],\[3,4\]\], r = 2, c = 4
**Output:** \[\[1,2\],\[3,4\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == mat.length`
*   `n == mat[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `-1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `1 <= r, c <= 300`","```python
def matrixReshape(mat, r, c):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])

Image Smoother,Easy,"An **image smoother** is a filter of the size `3 x 3` that can be applied to each cell of an image by rounding down the average of the cell and the eight surrounding cells (i.e., the average of the nine cells in the blue smoother). If one or more of the surrounding cells of a cell is not present, we do not consider it in the average (i.e., the average of the four cells in the red smoother).

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `img` representing the grayscale of an image, return _the image after applying the smoother on each cell of it_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** img = \[\[1,1,1\],\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[0,0,0\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Explanation:**

Shortest Distance to a Character,Easy,"Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer.length == s.length` _and_ `answer[i]` _is the **distance** from index_ `i` _to the **closest** occurrence of character_ `c` _in_ `s`.

The **distance** between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs` is the absolute value function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""loveleetcode "", c =  ""e ""
**Output:** \[3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0\]
**Explanation:** The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""aaab "", c =  ""b ""
**Output:** \[3,2,1,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s[i]` and `c` are lowercase English letters.
*   It is guaranteed that `c` occurs at least once in `s`.","```python

Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers,Easy,"You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

*   For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return _the sum of these numbers_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bits** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,0,1,0,1,0,1\]
**Output:** 22
**Explanation:** (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22

Determine if String Halves Are Alike,Easy,"You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let `a` be the first half and `b` be the second half.

Two strings are **alike** if they have the same number of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, `'A'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`). Notice that `s` contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return `true` _if_ `a` _and_ `b` _are **alike**_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""book ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** a =  ""bo "" and b =  ""ok "". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""textbook ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** a =  ""text "" and b =  ""book "". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.

Number of Valid Words in a Sentence,Easy,"A sentence consists of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), digits (`'0'` to `'9'`), hyphens (`'-'`), punctuation marks (`'!'`, `'.'`, and `','`), and spaces (`' '`) only. Each sentence can be broken down into **one or more tokens** separated by one or more spaces `' '`.

A token is a valid word if **all three** of the following are true:

*   It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens, and/or punctuation (**no** digits).
*   There is **at most one** hyphen `'-'`. If present, it **must** be surrounded by lowercase characters ( `""a-b ""` is valid, but `""-ab ""` and `""ab- ""` are not valid).
*   There is **at most one** punctuation mark. If present, it **must** be at the **end** of the token ( `""ab, ""`, `""cd! ""`, and `"". ""` are valid, but `""a!b ""` and `""c., ""` are not valid).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,9,1,3,9,5\], key = 9, k = 1
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** Here, `nums[2] == key` and `nums[5] == key. - For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j` where `|0 - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index. - For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index. - For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index. - For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index. - For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index. - For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index. - For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.`
