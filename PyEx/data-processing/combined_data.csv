One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example. The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position.

The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better? As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better? Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12

As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.
Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

} The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n. But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the concept is surprisingly simple.


Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121. ""Sieve of Eratosthenes Animation"" by SKopp is licensed under CC BY 2.0.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well? 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by 2, which means all multiples of 4 must also be divisible by 2 and were already marked off. So we can skip 4 immediately and go to the next number, 5. Now, all multiples of 5 such as 5 × 2 = 10, 5 × 3 = 15, 5 × 4 = 20, 5 × 5 = 25, ... can be marked off. There is a slight optimization here, we do not need to start from 5 × 2 = 10. Where should we start marking off? In fact, we can mark off multiples of 5 starting at 5 × 5 = 25, because 5 × 2 = 10 was already marked off by multiple of 2, similarly 5 × 3 = 15 was already marked off by multiple of 3. Therefore, if the current number is p, we can always mark off multiples of p starting at p2, then in increments of p: p2 + p, p2 + 2p, ... Now what should be the terminating loop condition? It is easy to say that the terminating loop condition is p < n, which is certainly correct but not efficient. Do you still remember Hint #3? Yes, the terminating loop condition can be p < √n, as all non-primes ≥ √n must have already been marked off. When the loop terminates, all the numbers in the table that are non-marked are prime.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes uses an extra O(n) memory and its runtime complexity is O(n log log n). For the more mathematically inclined readers, you can read more about its algorithm complexity on Wikipedia.

We will allocate rooms to meetings that occur earlier in the day v/s the ones that occur later on, right? If you've figured out that we have to sort the meetings by their start time, the next thing to think about is how do we do the allocation? There are two scenarios possible here for any meeting. Either there is no meeting room available and a new one has to be allocated, or a meeting room has freed up and this meeting can take place there. An important thing to note is that we don't really care which room gets freed up while allocating a room for the current meeting. As long as a room is free, our job is done. We already know the rooms we have allocated till now and we also know when are they due to get free because of the end times of the meetings going on in those rooms. We can simply check the room which is due to get vacated the earliest amongst all the allocated rooms. Following up on the previous hint, we can make use of a min-heap to store the end times of the meetings in various rooms. So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

If the room we extracted from the top of the min heap isn't free, then no other room is. So, we can save time here and simply allocate a new room.","56,252,452,1184","Merge Intervals,Meeting Rooms,Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons,Car Pooling",,,,,

Can we somehow find the number of misplaced parentheses and use it in our solution? For every left parenthesis, we should have a corresponding right parenthesis. We can make use of two counters which keep track of misplaced left and right parenthesis and in one iteration we can find out these two values.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character): If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"".

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data. ","Array,Bit Manipulation",Medium,39.2,171170.0,67031.0,365.0,1508.0,"All you have to do is follow the rules. For a given integer, obtain its binary representation in the string form and work with the rules given in the problem. An integer can either represent the start of a UTF-8 character, or a part of an existing UTF-8 character. There are two separate rules for these two scenarios in the problem. If an integer is a part of an existing UTF-8 character, simply check the 2 most significant bits of in the binary representation string. They should be 10. If the integer represents the start of a UTF-8 character, then the first few bits would be 1 followed by a 0. The number of initial bits (most significant) bits determines the length of the UTF-8 character. 


Note: The array can contain multiple valid UTF-8 characters. String manipulation will work fine here. But, it is too slow. Can we instead use bit manipulation to do the validations instead of string manipulations? We can use bit masking to check how many initial bits are set for a given number. We only need to work with the 8 least significant bits as mentioned in the problem.

mask = 1 << 7
while mask & num:
    n_bytes += 1
    mask = mask >> 1


Can you use bit-masking to perform the second validation as well i.e. checking if the most significant bit is 1 and the second most significant bit a 0? To check if the most significant bit is a 1 and the second most significant bit is a 0, we can make use of the following two masks.

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists. For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way: Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

1290,The Dining Philosophers,the-dining-philosophers,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks. Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.  The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org  The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order.

2238,Minimum Reverse Operations,minimum-reverse-operations,,,Hard,,,,,,,,,"You are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a **0-indexed** array `arr` of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`.

You are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the **i****th** position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.

You can perform **multiple** operations on `arr`. In an operation, you can choose a **subarray** with size `k` and **reverse** the subarray. However, the `1` in `arr` should never go to any of the positions in `banned`. In other words, after each operation `arr[banned[i]]` **remains** `0`.

_Return an array_ `ans` _where_ _for each_ `i` _from_ `[0, n - 1]`, `ans[i]` _is the **minimum** number of reverse operations needed to bring the_ `1` _to position_ `i` _in arr_, _or_ `-1` _if it is impossible_.

*   A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.
*   The values of `ans[i]` are independent for all `i`'s.
*   The **reverse** of an array is an array containing the values in **reverse order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, p = 0, banned = \[1,2\], k = 4
**Output:** \[0,-1,-1,1\]
**Explanation:** In this case `k = 4` so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is `0`. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is `-1`. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is `1`. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, p = 0, banned = \[2,4\], k = 3
**Output:** \[0,-1,-1,-1,-1\]
**Explanation:** In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is `0`. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray `[0, 2]` for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions `-1`. 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, p = 2, banned = \[0,1,3\], k = 1
**Output:** \[-1,-1,0,-1\]
**Explanation:** In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= p <= n - 1`
*   `0 <= banned.length <= n - 1`
*   `0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1`

Calculate the possible `an` value by getting the absolute difference between `p` and `i` and divide it by `k`.\n6. If the absolute difference between `p` and `i` modulo `k` is zero, and the bitwise AND of `an`, `n-1`, and `k` equals, set the `ans[i]` to the value of `an`.\n7. Otherwise, set the `ans[i]` to -1.\n8. Set `ans[p]` to 0.\n9. Return the `ans` array.\n\nThe main idea of the algorithm is to check if the current index `i` is reachable or not under the constraints of the problem. We calculate the required steps for the number `1` to reach the position `i`, and if it is an available position, we update the result accordingly. Otherwise, we keep the default value of -1 for the position. \n\nThe bitwise operations are used to calculate the parity relationship between the positions based on the constraints. If the positions are reachable, their parity should match each other with respect to the restrictions.\n'}",,,

The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;

}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3

 ""5 "" - Add 5 to the record, record is now \[5\].
 ""2 "" - Add 2 to the record, record is now \[5, 2\].
 ""C "" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now \[5\].

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,2,3,1\]

2719,Sentence Similarity,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence `""I am happy with leetcode ""` can be represented as `arr = [ ""I "", ""am "",happy "", ""with "", ""leetcode ""]`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs `similarPairs` where `similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates that the two words `xi` and `yi` are similar.

Return _`true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar, or `false` if they are not similar_.

Two sentences are similar if:

*   They have **the same length** (i.e., the same number of words)
*   `sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words `a` and `b` are similar, and the words `b` and `c` are similar, `a` and `c` are **not necessarily similar**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence1 = \[ ""great "", ""acting "", ""skills ""\], sentence2 = \[ ""fine "", ""drama "", ""talent ""\], similarPairs = \[\[ ""great "", ""fine ""\],\[ ""drama "", ""acting ""\],\[ ""skills "", ""talent ""\]\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sentence1 = \[ ""great ""\], sentence2 = \[ ""great ""\], similarPairs = \[\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** A word is similar to itself.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sentence1 = \[ ""great ""\], sentence2 = \[ ""doubleplus "", ""good ""\], similarPairs = \[\[ ""great "", ""doubleplus ""\]\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** As they don't have the same length, we return false.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= sentence1[i].length, sentence2[i].length <= 20`
*   `sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` consist of English letters.
*   `0 <= similarPairs.length <= 1000`
*   `similarPairs[i].length == 2`
*   `1 <= xi.length, yi.length <= 20`
*   `xi` and `yi` consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.
*   All the pairs `(xi, yi)` are **distinct**.","```python

Determine whether the largest element in the array is **at least twice** as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return _the **index** of the largest element, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,6,1,0\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 6 is the largest integer.

2721,Shortest Completing Word,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the **shortest completing** word in `words`.

A **completing** word is a word that **contains all the letters** in `licensePlate`. **Ignore numbers and spaces** in `licensePlate`, and treat letters as **case insensitive**. If a letter appears more than once in `licensePlate`, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.

For example, if `licensePlate` `= ""aBc 12c ""`, then it contains letters `'a'`, `'b'` (ignoring case), and `'c'` twice. Possible **completing** words are `""abccdef ""`, `""caaacab ""`, and `""cbca ""`.

Return _the shortest **completing** word in_ `words`_._ It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest **completing** words, return the **first** one that occurs in `words`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** licensePlate =  ""1s3 PSt "", words = \[ ""step "", ""steps "", ""stripe "", ""stepple ""\]
**Output:**  ""steps ""
**Explanation:** licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.
 ""step "" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.
 ""steps "" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.
 ""stripe "" is missing an 's'.
 ""stepple "" is missing an 's'.
Since  ""steps "" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** licensePlate =  ""1s3 456 "", words = \[ ""looks "", ""pest "", ""stew "", ""show ""\]
**Output:**  ""pest ""
**Explanation:** licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these  ""pest "",  ""stew "", and  ""show "" are shortest. The answer is  ""pest "" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= licensePlate.length <= 7`
*   `licensePlate` contains digits, letters (uppercase or lowercase), or space `' '`.
*   `1 <= words.length <= 1000`

An array `a` is **an anagram** of an array `b` means `b` is made by randomizing the order of the elements in `a`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[12,28,46,32,50\], nums2 = \[50,12,32,46,28\]
**Output:** \[1,4,3,2,0\]
**Explanation:** As mapping\[0\] = 1 because the 0th element of nums1 appears at nums2\[1\], and mapping\[1\] = 4 because the 1st element of nums1 appears at nums2\[4\], and so on.

The words in `paragraph` are **case-insensitive** and the answer should be returned in **lowercase**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** paragraph =  ""Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit. "", banned = \[ ""hit ""\]
**Output:**  ""ball ""
**Explanation:** 
 ""hit "" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
 ""ball "" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as  ""ball, ""), 
and that  ""hit "" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** paragraph =  ""a. "", banned = \[\]

The **distance** between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs` is the absolute value function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""loveleetcode "", c =  ""e ""
**Output:** \[3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0\]
**Explanation:** The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

**Explanation:** 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.

*   For example, in `""alice@leetcode.com ""`, `""alice ""` is the **local name**, and `""leetcode.com ""` is the **domain name**.

If you add periods `'.'` between some characters in the **local name** part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule **does not apply** to **domain names**.

*   For example, `""alice.z@leetcode.com ""` and `""alicez@leetcode.com ""` forward to the same email address.

If you add a plus `'+'` in the **local name**, everything after the first plus sign **will be ignored**. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule **does not apply** to **domain names**.

*   For example, `""m.y+name@email.com ""` will be forwarded to `""my@email.com ""`.

cae

You want to **delete** the columns that are **not sorted lexicographically**. In the above example (**0-indexed**), columns 0 (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`) and 2 (`'c'`, `'e'`, `'e'`) are sorted, while column 1 (`'b'`, `'c'`, `'a'`) is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return _the number of columns that you will delete_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \[ ""cba "", ""daf "", ""ghi ""\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf

Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[ ""a "", ""b ""\]

Design a stream that returns the values in **increasing order of their IDs** by returning a **chunk** (list) of values after each insertion. The concatenation of all the **chunks** should result in a list of the sorted values.

Implement the `OrderedStream` class:

*   `OrderedStream(int n)` Constructs the stream to take `n` values.
*   `String[] insert(int idKey, String value)` Inserts the pair `(idKey, value)` into the stream, then returns the **largest possible chunk** of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.

os.insert(5,  ""eeeee ""); // Inserts (5,  ""eeeee ""), returns \[\].
os.insert(4,  ""ddddd ""); // Inserts (4,  ""ddddd ""), returns \[ ""ddddd "",  ""eeeee ""\].
// Concatentating all the chunks returned:
// \[\] + \[ ""aaaaa ""\] + \[ ""bbbbb "",  ""ccccc ""\] + \[\] + \[ ""ddddd "",  ""eeeee ""\] = \[ ""aaaaa "",  ""bbbbb "",  ""ccccc "",  ""ddddd "",  ""eeeee ""\]

**Input:** number =  ""1-23-45 6 ""
**Output:**  ""123-456 ""
**Explanation:** The digits are  ""123456 "".
Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is  ""123 "".
Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is  ""456 "".
Joining the blocks gives  ""123-456 "".

Return `abs(i - start)`.

It is **guaranteed** that `target` exists in `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5\], target = 5, start = 3
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** nums\[4\] = 5 is the only value equal to target, so the answer is abs(4 - 3) = 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], target = 1, start = 0

You are given a string `rings` of length `2n` that describes the `n` rings that are placed onto the rods. Every two characters in `rings` forms a **color-position pair** that is used to describe each ring where:

*   The **first** character of the `ith` pair denotes the `ith` ring's **color** (`'R'`, `'G'`, `'B'`).
*   The **second** character of the `ith` pair denotes the **rod** that the `ith` ring is placed on (`'0'` to `'9'`).

For example, `""R3G2B1 ""` describes `n == 3` rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled 1.

Return _the number of rods that have **all three colors** of rings on them._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rings =  ""B0B6G0R6R0R6G9 ""

*   The first group consists of the first `k` characters of the string, the second group consists of the next `k` characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of **exactly one** group.
*   For the last group, if the string **does not** have `k` characters remaining, a character `fill` is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the `fill` character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Given the string `s`, the size of each group `k` and the character `fill`, return _a string array denoting the **composition of every group**_ `s` _has been divided into, using the above procedure_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""abcdefghi "", k = 3, fill =  ""x ""

**Explanation:**
The first 3 characters  ""abc "" form the first group.
The next 3 characters  ""def "" form the second group.
The last 3 characters  ""ghi "" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
Thus, the groups formed are  ""abc "",  ""def "", and  ""ghi "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""abcdefghij "", k = 3, fill =  ""x ""
**Output:** \[ ""abc "", ""def "", ""ghi "", ""jxx ""\]
**Explanation:**
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups  ""abc "",  ""def "", and  ""ghi "".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
Thus, the 4 groups formed are  ""abc "",  ""def "",  ""ghi "", and  ""jxx "".

*   For example, if there are `4` candies with costs `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and the customer buys candies with costs `2` and `3`, they can take the candy with cost `1` for free, but not the candy with cost `4`.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` denotes the cost of the `ith` candy, return _the **minimum cost** of buying **all** the candies_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the **only** way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = \[6,5,7,9,2,2\]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:
- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cost = \[5,5\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Since there are only 2 candies, we buy both of them. There is not a third candy we can take for free.
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 5 + 5 = 10.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= cost.length <= 100`

2859,Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. Rearrange the values of `nums` according to the following rules:

1.  Sort the values at **odd indices** of `nums` in **non-increasing** order.
    *   For example, if `nums = [4,**1**,2,**3**]` before this step, it becomes `[4,**3**,2,**1**]` after. The values at odd indices `1` and `3` are sorted in non-increasing order.
2.  Sort the values at **even indices** of `nums` in **non-decreasing** order.
    *   For example, if `nums = [**4**,1,**2**,3]` before this step, it becomes `[**2**,1,**4**,3]` after. The values at even indices `0` and `2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return _the array formed after rearranging the values of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[2,3,4,1\]
**Explanation:** 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from \[4,**1**,2,**3**\] to \[4,**3**,2,**1**\].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from \[**4**,1,**2**,3\] to \[**2**,3,**4**,1\].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is \[2,3,4,1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1\]
**Output:** \[2,1\]
**Explanation:** 
Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.
The resultant array formed is \[2,1\], which is the same as the initial array.

2861,Most Frequent Number Following Key In an Array,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You are also given an integer `key`, which is present in `nums`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,100,200,1,100\], key = 1
**Output:** 100
**Explanation:** For target = 100, there are 2 occurrences at indices 1 and 4 which follow an occurrence of key.
No other integers follow an occurrence of key, so we return 100.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,9,1,3,9,5\], key = 9, k = 1
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** Here, `nums[2] == key` and `nums[5] == key. - For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j` where `|0 - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index. - For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index. - For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index. - For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index. - For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index. - For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index. - For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.`

2871,Find the K-Beauty of a Number,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"The **k-beauty** of an integer `num` is defined as the number of **substrings** of `num` when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

*   It has a length of `k`.
*   It is a divisor of `num`.

Given integers `num` and `k`, return _the k-beauty of_ `num`.

Note:

*   **Leading zeros** are allowed.
*   `0` is not a divisor of any value.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 240, k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The following are the substrings of num of length k:
-  ""24 "" from  ""**24**0 "": 24 is a divisor of 240.
-  ""40 "" from  ""2**40** "": 40 is a divisor of 240.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 430043, k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The following are the substrings of num of length k:
-  ""43 "" from  ""**43**0043 "": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
-  ""30 "" from  ""4**30**043 "": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.

2872,Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"You are given a **0-indexed** string array `words`, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, select any index `i` such that `0 < i < words.length` and `words[i - 1]` and `words[i]` are **anagrams**, and **delete** `words[i]` from `words`. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return `words` _after performing all operations_. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, `""dacb ""` is an anagram of `""abdc ""`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""abba "", ""baba "", ""bbaa "", ""cd "", ""cd ""\]
**Output:** \[ ""abba "", ""cd ""\]
**Explanation:**
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words\[2\] =  ""bbaa "" and words\[1\] =  ""baba "" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words\[2\].
  Now words = \[ ""abba "", ""baba "", ""cd "", ""cd ""\].
- Since words\[1\] =  ""baba "" and words\[0\] =  ""abba "" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words\[1\].
  Now words = \[ ""abba "", ""cd "", ""cd ""\].
- Since words\[2\] =  ""cd "" and words\[1\] =  ""cd "" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words\[2\].
  Now words = \[ ""abba "", ""cd ""\].
We can no longer perform any operations, so \[ ""abba "", ""cd ""\] is the final answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""a "", ""b "", ""c "", ""d "", ""e ""\]
**Output:** \[ ""a "", ""b "", ""c "", ""d "", ""e ""\]
**Explanation:**
No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.

2880,Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

*   For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return _the sum of these numbers_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bits** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,0,1,0,1,0,1\]
**Output:** 22
**Explanation:** (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[0\]
**Output:** 0

Given a string `s`​​​​​, return _the number of **good substrings** of length **three** in_ `s`​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""xyzzaz ""
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are 4 substrings of size 3:  ""xyz "",  ""yzz "",  ""zza "", and  ""zaz "". 
The only good substring of length 3 is  ""xyz "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""aababcabc ""
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** There are 7 substrings of size 3:  ""aab "",  ""aba "",  ""bab "",  ""abc "",  ""bca "",  ""cab "", and  ""abc "".
The good substrings are  ""abc "",  ""bca "",  ""cab "", and  ""abc "".

2893,Number of Valid Words in a Sentence,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"A sentence consists of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), digits (`'0'` to `'9'`), hyphens (`'-'`), punctuation marks (`'!'`, `'.'`, and `','`), and spaces (`' '`) only. Each sentence can be broken down into **one or more tokens** separated by one or more spaces `' '`.

A token is a valid word if **all three** of the following are true:

*   It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens, and/or punctuation (**no** digits).
*   There is **at most one** hyphen `'-'`. If present, it **must** be surrounded by lowercase characters ( `""a-b ""` is valid, but `""-ab ""` and `""ab- ""` are not valid).
*   There is **at most one** punctuation mark. If present, it **must** be at the **end** of the token ( `""ab, ""`, `""cd! ""`, and `"". ""` are valid, but `""a!b ""` and `""c., ""` are not valid).

Examples of valid words include `""a-b. ""`, `""afad ""`, `""ba-c ""`, `""a! ""`, and `""! ""`.

Given a string `sentence`, return _the **number** of valid words in_ `sentence`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence =  ""cat and  dog ""
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The valid words in the sentence are  ""cat "",  ""and "", and  ""dog "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sentence =  ""!this  1-s b8d! ""
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no valid words in the sentence.
 ""!this "" is invalid because it starts with a punctuation mark.
 ""1-s "" and  ""b8d "" are invalid because they contain digits.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sentence =  ""alice and  bob are playing stone-game10 ""
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The valid words in the sentence are  ""alice "",  ""and "",  ""bob "",  ""are "", and  ""playing "".

2896,Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"You are given a **positive** integer `num` consisting of exactly four digits. Split `num` into two new integers `new1` and `new2` by using the **digits** found in `num`. **Leading zeros** are allowed in `new1` and `new2`, and **all** the digits found in `num` must be used.

*   For example, given `num = 2932`, you have the following digits: two `2`'s, one `9` and one `3`. Some of the possible pairs `[new1, new2]` are `[22, 93]`, `[23, 92]`, `[223, 9]` and `[2, 329]`.

2897,Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array,,,,Easy,,,,,,,,,"You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and two integers `key` and `k`. A **k-distant index** is an index `i` of `nums` for which there exists at least one index `j` such that `|i - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key`.

Return _a list of all k-distant indices sorted in **increasing order**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,9,1,3,9,5\], key = 9, k = 1
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** Here, `nums[2] == key` and `nums[5] == key. - For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j` where `|0 - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index. - For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index. - For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index. - For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index. - For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index. - For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index. - For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.`
Thus, we return \[1,2,3,4,5,6\] which is sorted in increasing order. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,2,2,2\], key = 2, k = 2
**Output:** \[0,1,2,3,4\]
**Explanation:** For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums\[j\] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. 
Hence, we return \[0,1,2,3,4\].
